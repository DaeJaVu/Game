This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card. 

The SD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for two targets:

LM3S6965:  Standalone application for Luminary LM3S6965 Board
           using COM# virtual serial port.

           Use HyperTerminal and select the COM# Windows has 
           assigned to the Virtual COM port on the LM3S6965 
           evaluation board. Set the serial connection to
           115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and no 
           flow control.

Note: SD Card and OLED display share the same SPI interface on
      EK-LM3S6965 Evaluation Board.
