This program shows you how to resolve an IP address of a Host
from the Host name. It sends a DNS request to a remote DNS server. 

This example will configure the LAN network parameters for 
the evaluation board automatically if a DHCP Server is available
in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

The DNS_demo example is available for several targets:

LM3S6965:       Standalone application for Luminary LM3S6965 Board.
                Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

LM3S6965 Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
                in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
                System messages printed to COM# virtual serial port.

                Use HyperTerminal to view output messages and select
                the COM# Windows has assigned to the Virtual COM port on
                the LM3S6965 evaluation board. Set the serial connection 
                to 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and no flow
                control.
