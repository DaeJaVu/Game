This program is a LEDSwitch Client example. It is used to send commands
to a LEDSwitch Server connected on the same LAN. The sending commands 
control LED diodes on remote Server, how they are switched on or off.

In order to run this example, you need to set the network parameters
to match your local area network.

To test this example, run application LEDSwitch on one LM3S6965
board and Client application on another Luminary LM3S6965 board. 
The Client application sends the value of P2 to LEDSwitch 
application over TCP or UDP.

NOTE: IP address and MAC address of this example must be set different
      from IP and MAC addressess on LEDSwitch Server.

The Client example is available for several targets:

LM3S6965:       Standalone application for Luminary LM3S6965 Board.
                Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

LM3S6965 Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
                in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
                Use HyperTerminal to view output messages and select
                the COM# Windows has assigned to the Virtual COM port on
                the LM3S6965 evaluation board. Set the serial connection 
                to 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and no flow
                control.
