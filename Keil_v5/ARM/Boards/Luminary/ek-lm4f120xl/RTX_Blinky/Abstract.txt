The RTX_Blinky project is a simple program for the 'LM4F120'
microcontroller using 'TI EK-LM4F120XL Evaluation Board'.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             = 16.00 MHz
   - SYS   = XTAL     = 16.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LM4F120 RAM:       runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                     (used for target debugging)

  LM4F120 Flash:     configured for on-chip Flash
                     (used for production or target debugging)
