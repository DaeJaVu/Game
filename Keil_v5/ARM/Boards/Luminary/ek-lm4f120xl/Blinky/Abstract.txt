The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the 'LM4F120'
microcontroller using 'TI EK-LM4F120XL Evaluation Board'

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             = 16.00 MHz
   - SYS   = XTAL     = 16.00 MHz

 - 3 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer working in interrupt mode
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port UART0
   UART0 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 - if push button SW1 is pressed all LEDs are lit.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LM4F120 RAM:       runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                     (used for target debugging)

  LM4F120 Flash:     configured for on-chip Flash
                     (used for production or target debugging)
