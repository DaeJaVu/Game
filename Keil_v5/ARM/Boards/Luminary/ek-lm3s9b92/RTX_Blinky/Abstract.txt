The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
Luminary 'LM3S9B92' microcontroller using Luminary EK-LM3S9B92' 
evaluation board and is compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.20).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  16 MHz
   - CCLK  =  50 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. One LED is blinking representing a clock task. Four
task simulate the output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  LM3S9B92 Flash:     configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
