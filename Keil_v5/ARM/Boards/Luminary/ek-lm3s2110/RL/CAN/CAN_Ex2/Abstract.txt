This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'LM3S2110 CAN DEVICE' with 'Luminary LM3S2110' microcontroller 
(should be used with 'LM3S8962 EVALUATION BOARD' board 
to see complete functionality).

Example functionality:
 - set incrementing value in first byte in CAN message 
   that will automatically be sent upon reception of 
   remote transmission request
 - display LSB bit of set byte on STATUS LED
   CAN controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver.

The CAN_Ex2 example program is available for several targets:

LM3S2110 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:      
  - this example works together with CAN_Ex2 example for 
    'LM3S8962 EVALUATION BOARD' board which can be found 
    in folder: Boards\Luminary\EK-LM3S8962\RL\CAN\CAN_Ex2
