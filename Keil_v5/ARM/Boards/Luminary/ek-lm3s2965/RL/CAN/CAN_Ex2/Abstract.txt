This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'LM3S2965 EVALUATION BOARD' with 'Luminary LM3S2965' microcontroller 
(should be used with 'LM3S2110 CAN DEVICE' board 
to see complete functionality).

Example functionality:
 - send remote transmission request on CAN controller 
   every 1 second
 - display received value on OLED display
 - display 100 ms pulse signal every 1 second on STATUS LED
   CAN controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver.

The CAN_Ex2 example program is available for several targets:

LM3S2965 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:      
  - this example works together with CAN_Ex2 example for 
    'LM3S2110 CAN DEVICE' board which can be found 
    in folder: Boards\Luminary\EK-LM3S2110\RL\CAN\CAN_Ex2
