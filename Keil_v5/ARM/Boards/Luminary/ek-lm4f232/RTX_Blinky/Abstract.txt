The RTX_Blinky project is a simple program for the 'LM4F232'
microcontroller using 'TI EK-LM4F232 Evaluation Board'.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             = 16.00 MHz
   - PLL not used
   - SYS   = XTAL     = 16.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available for target:

  LN4F232 Flash:     configured for on-chip Flash
                     (used for production or target debugging)
