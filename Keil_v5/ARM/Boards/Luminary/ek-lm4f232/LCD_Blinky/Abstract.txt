The LCD_Blinky project is a simple program for the 'LM4F232'
microcontroller using 'TI EK-LM4F232 Evaluation Board'.

It blinks the Status LED and shows time and button 
states on OLED display.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             = 16.00 MHz
   - PLL not used 
   - SYS   = XTAL     = 16.00 MHz
 - LED STATUS toggles every 1 second
   (LED STATUS is connected to PG2)
 - Button states are shown on OLED display
 - If SW5 is pressed time is stopped


The Blinky program is available for target:

  LN4F232 Flash:     configured for on-chip Flash
                     (used for production or target debugging)
