This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'LM3S8962 EVALUATION BOARD' with 'Luminary LM3S8962' microcontroller 
(should be used with 'LM3S2110 CAN DEVICE' board 
to see complete functionality).

Example functionality:
 - send incrementing value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN controller every 1 second
 - display values transmitted and received on CAN controller 
   on OLED display
 - display 100 ms pulse signal every 1 second on STATUS LED
   CAN controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver.

The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for several targets:

LM3S8962 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:      
  - this example works together with CAN_Ex1 example for 
    'LM3S2110 CAN DEVICE' board which can be found 
    in folder: Boards\Luminary\EK-LM3S2110\RL\CAN\CAN_Ex1
