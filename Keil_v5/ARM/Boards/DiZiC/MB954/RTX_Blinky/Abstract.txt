The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
the ST 'STM32W108CC' microcontroller using DiZiC 'MB954' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - SCLK  =             24.00 MHz
   - FCLK    = SCLK/2  = 12.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32W108 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)

  STM32W108 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
