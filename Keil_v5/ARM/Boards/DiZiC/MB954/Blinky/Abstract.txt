The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32W108CC' 
microcontroller using DiZiC 'MB954' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - SCLK  =             24.00 MHz
   - FCLK    = SCLK/2  = 12.00 MHz

 - 2 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if Button S1 is pressed both LEDs are lit.



The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32W108 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)

  STM32W108 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
