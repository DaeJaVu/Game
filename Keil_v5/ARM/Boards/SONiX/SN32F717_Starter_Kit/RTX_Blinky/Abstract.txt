The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
SONiX 'SN32F717' microcontroller using SONiX 'SN32F717_Starter_Kit' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =    
   - CPU     =    (IHRC) 12.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SN32F717 Flash:     configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
