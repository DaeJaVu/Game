The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the SN32F717 microcontroller
using SONiX 'SN32F717_Starter_Kit' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =
   - CPU     =    (IHRC) 12.00 MHz

 - 2 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port UART0
   UART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SN32F717 Flash JLink: configured for on-chip Flash (uses JLink Debugger)
                        (used for production or target debugging)

  SN32F717 Flash:       configured for on-chip Flash (uses ULINK2/ME Debugger)
                        (used for production or target debugging)

  SN32F717 RAM:         configured for on-chip RAM (uses ULINK2/ME Debugger)
                        (used for target debugging)
