The 'Blinky' project is a simple example for Energy Micro
EFM32 LeopardGecko Series using Energy Micro EFM32LG_STK3600 Starter Kit.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =    
   - CPU     =    14.00 MHz

 - 2 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - "Hello World" is output onto SWO (ITM port 0)


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  EFM32LG990F256 Flash:           runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)
