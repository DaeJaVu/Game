The 'Blinky' project is a simple example for Energy Micro
EFM32 Gecko Series using Energy Micro EFM32-Gxxx-DK Development Kit.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =    
   - CPU     =    14.00 MHz

 - 8 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port 'SERIAL A' 
   UART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  EFM32G290F128 Flash:            populated with EFM32G290F128 MCU board
                                  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  EFM32G890F128 Flash:            populated with EFM32G890F128 MCU board
                                  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)
