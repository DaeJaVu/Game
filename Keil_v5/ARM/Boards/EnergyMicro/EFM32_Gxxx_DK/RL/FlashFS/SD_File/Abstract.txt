This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card. 

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =    
   - CPU     =     14.00 MHz

   - USART1: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The SD_FILE program is a standalone application for Energy Micro EFM32 
Gecko Series using using Energy Micro EFM32-Gxxx-DK Development Kit. 
It uses Serial port 'SERIAL A' as communication interface.

The application is loaded into on-chip flash and available for targets:

  EFM32G290F128 Flash:            populated with EFM32G290F128 MCU board
                                  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  EFM32G890F128 Flash:            populated with EFM32G890F128 MCU board
                                  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)
