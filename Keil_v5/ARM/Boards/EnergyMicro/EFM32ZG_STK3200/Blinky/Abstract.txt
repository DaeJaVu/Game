The 'Blinky' project is a simple example for
Energy Micro EFM32 ZeroGecko Series using Energy Micro EFM32ZG_STK3200 Starter Kit.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =    
   - CPU     =    14.00 MHz

 - 2 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  EFM32ZG222F32 Flash:            runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)
