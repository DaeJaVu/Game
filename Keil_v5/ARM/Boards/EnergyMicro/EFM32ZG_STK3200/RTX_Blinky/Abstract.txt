The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
Energy Micro EFM32 ZeroGecko Series using Energy Micro EFM32ZG_STK3200 Starter Kit.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =    
   - CPU     =    14.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  EFM32ZG222F32 Flash:            runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)
