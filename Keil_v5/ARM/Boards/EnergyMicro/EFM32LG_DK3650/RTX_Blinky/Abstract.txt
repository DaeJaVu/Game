The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
Energy Micro EFM32 LeopardGecko Series using Energy Micro 'EFM32LG_DK3650 Development Kit".

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =
   - CPU     =    14.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.

  EFM32LG990F256 RAM:            runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                 (used for production or target debugging)

  EFM32LG990F256 Flash:          runs from Internal Flash located on chip
