The 'Blinky' project is a simple example for
Energy Micro EFM32 LeopardGecko Series using Energy Micro 'EFM32LG_DK3650 Development Kit".

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =
   - CPU     =    14.00 MHz

 - 16 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port 'UART'
   UART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  EFM32LG990F256 RAM:            runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                 (used for production or target debugging)

  EFM32LG990F256 Flash:          runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                 (used for production or target debugging)
