The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MKM34' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'TWR-KM34Z50M' evaluation board populated with
MKM34Z128xxx5 device, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 48 MHz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 4 LEDs (PTC1,PTD1,PTF1,PTE5) blink every 500 ms 
 - AD conversion is done in polling mode 
   AD settings: 16 bit resolution
   AD value (potentiometer position) is output on the Segment LCD 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  ULink-Flash:                     Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  ULink-RAM:                       Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)
