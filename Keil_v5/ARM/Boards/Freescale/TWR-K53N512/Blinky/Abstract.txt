The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MK50' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'TWR-K53N512' evaluation board populated with
K53N512CMD100 device, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 50 MHz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 2 LEDs (PTC.7.8) blink every 250 ms 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  ULink-Flash:                     Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  ULink-RAM:                       Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)

  UlinkPro-Flash:                  Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINKPro
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  UlinkPro-RAM:                    Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINKPro
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)

  PE OSJTAG-Flash:                Debug/Target Driver is configured as P&E Micro OSJTAG
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  PE OSJTAG-RAM:                  Debug/Target Driver is configured as P&E Micro OSJTAG
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)
