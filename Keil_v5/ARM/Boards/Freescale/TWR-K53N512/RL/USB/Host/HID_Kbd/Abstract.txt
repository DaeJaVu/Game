This is an RL-USB-Host Human Interface Device (HID) usage example.

Board configuration consists of: TWR-ELEV (PRIMARY+SECONDARY) + TWR-SER + 
                                 TWR-K53N512

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock =  96 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  48 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  48 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  24 MHz
   - USBFS   clock =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART3 (on TWR-SER): 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

This example shows how to use USB Keyboard as terminal input to 
the device and it uses UART as terminal output.

The Measure example is described in detail in the Getting Started
User's Guide.

The HID_KBD program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

K53N512:   Standalone application for the K53N512 Board.

Note: 

      Default jumper settings according user manual:
         - J1  = on          => ADC1_DM1 reads POTENTIOMETER
         - J11 = 1-2 shorted => Connect main EXTAL to on-board 50 MHz clock
         - J15 = on          => Connect on-board 3.3V supply to MCU
         - J17 = on          => Connect power to 50 MHz oscillator
         - J18 = on          => Connect USB0_VBUS from Elevator to VREGIN

      Jumpers position on the TWR-SER module:
         - J10 = 1-2 shorted => Supply 5V on USB Connector (Host Mode)
         - J16 = 1-2 shorted => Host Mode (supply 5V to VBUS)
