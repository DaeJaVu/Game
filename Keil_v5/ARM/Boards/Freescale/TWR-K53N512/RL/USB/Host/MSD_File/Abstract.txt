This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Board configuration consists of: TWR-ELEV (PRIMARY+SECONDARY) + TWR-SER + 
                                 TWR-K53N512

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock =  96 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  48 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  48 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  24 MHz
   - USBFS   clock =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART3 (on TWR-SER): 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

K53N512:   Standalone application for the K53N512 Board.

Note: 

      Default jumper settings according user manual:
         - J1  = on          => ADC1_DM1 reads POTENTIOMETER
         - J11 = 1-2 shorted => Connect main EXTAL to on-board 50 MHz clock
         - J15 = on          => Connect on-board 3.3V supply to MCU
         - J17 = on          => Connect power to 50 MHz oscillator
         - J18 = on          => Connect USB0_VBUS from Elevator to VREGIN

      Jumpers position on the TWR-SER module:
         - J10 = 1-2 shorted => Supply 5V on USB Connector (Host Mode)
         - J16 = 1-2 shorted => Host Mode (supply 5V to VBUS)
