The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MK21' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'TWR-K21F100M' evaluation board populated with
MK21FN1M0xxx10 device, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 48 MHz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs (PTD.4..6) blink every 250 ms 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  K21FN1M0 (ULink-Flash):          Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  K21FN1M0 (ULink-RAM):            Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)

  K21FN1M0 (ULPro-Flash)           Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINKPro
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  K21FN1M0 (ULPro-RAM)             Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINKPro
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)
