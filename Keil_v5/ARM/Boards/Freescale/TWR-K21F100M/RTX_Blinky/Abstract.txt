The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MK21' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'TWR-K21F100M' evaluation board populated with
MK21FN1M0xxx10 device, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 48 MHz                                                   

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. 3 LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The RTX_Blinky program is available in different targets:
  K21FN1M0 (ULink-Flash):          Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  K21FN1M0 (ULink-RAM):            Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)

  K21FN1M0 (ULPro-Flash)           Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINKPro
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  K21FN1M0 (ULPro-RAM)             Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINKPro
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)
