The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale Kinetis 'MK60' 
series microcontroller using the Freescale 'TWR-K60D100M' evaluation board 
populated with the 'K60DN512VMD10' device, 
compliant to the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock =  96 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  48 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  48 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  24 MHz
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs (PTA11, PTA28, PTA29) blink every 2 s (1 s on, 1 s off)
   (LED4 is not used as it shares same pin as TRACED3 line)
 - LED's ON/OFF Status is output onto ITM debug port #0
   
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  SWO Trace:                  runs from Internal Flash
                              shows use of ITM output, Exception Trace

  TracePort Trace:            runs from Internal Flash
                              shows use of ITM output, Exception Trace

  TracePort Intruction Trace: runs from Internal Flash
                              shows use of ITM output, Instruction Trace and Exception Trace

  Embedded Trace Buffer     : runs from Internal Flash
                              shows use of Instruction Trace

- ULINKpro notes
--------------
TracePort.ini enables synchronous 4bit Trace Interface
ETM Trace pins:  TRACE_CLK_OUT   PTA6
                 TRACE_D0..3     PTA10..PTA7    (4 bit trace data)
                 do not use these pins in your application!

TracePort.ini is not required for using the Embedded Trace Buffer.
