The 'Demo' project is a simple demonstration program for Freescale Kinetis 'MK60' 
series microcontroller using the Freescale 'TWR-K60D100M' evaluation board 
populated with the 'K60DN512VMD10' device, 
compliant to the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Board configuration consists of: TWR-ELEV (PRIMARY+SECONDARY) + TWR-SER + 
                                 TWR-K60D100M

System Settings:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock =  96 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  48 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  48 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  24 MHz
 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - USART5 (on TWR-SER): 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

Example functionality:
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 1 LED blinks with speed determined by ADC value (potentiometer position)
 - 2 LEDs show two buttons state
 - ADC value is output every 1 second to the Communication Interface

The Demo program is available for one target:

  K60D100M-ULink:                  Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)
  K60D100M-ULinkPro:               Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINKPro
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)
