The Memory project is a demo program for the TWR-K60D100M Tower  
module using a Freescale MK60DN512VMD10  Microcontroller.

Example functionality: 
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core clock     = 96MHz 
   - BusClock       = 48MHz 
   - FlexBus        = 48MHz 
   - Flash clock    = 24MHz
   
It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

  MK60DN512VMD10:    Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINKPro
                     runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                     (used for production or target debugging)
