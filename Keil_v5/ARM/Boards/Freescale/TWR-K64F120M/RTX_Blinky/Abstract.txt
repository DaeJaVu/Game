The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale Kinetis 'MK64' 
series microcontroller using the Freescale 'TWR-K64F120M' evaluation board 
populated with the 'K64FN1M0VMD12' device, 
compliant to the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Clock Settings: Core clock = 41.94 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. 4 LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The RTX_Blinky program is available for different targets:
  ULink-Flash:                     Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  ULink-RAM:                       Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)
