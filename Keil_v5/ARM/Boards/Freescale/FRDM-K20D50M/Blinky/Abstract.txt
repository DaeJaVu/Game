The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MK20' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'FRDM-K20D50M' evaluation board populated with
MK20DX128xxx5 device, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 48 MHz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - Green/Red/Blue LED(PTD.4,PTC.3,PTA.2) blink every 500 ms 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  CMSIS-DAP-Flash:                 Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  CMSIS-DAP-RAM:                   Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)

  PE OSJTAG-Flash:                 Debug/Target Driver is configured as PE OSJTAG
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  PE OSJTAG-RAM:                   Debug/Target Driver is configured as PE OSJTAG
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)

  ULink-Flash:                     Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  ULink-RAM:                       Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)


ULINK note: For using ULINK Debug/Target driver, Samtec FTSH-105-02-F-D or compatible connectors can be added
      to the J6 through-hole debug connector to allow for an external debug cable to be connected.


Selecting "PE OSJTAG" or "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application:
 1. Start OpenSDA in bootloader mode: Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection whilst pushbutton, SW1 is pressed. 
 2. Drag and drop "PE OSJTAG" or "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file to the OpenSDA mass storage device. 
 3. Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection.
 
Note:
 - PE OSJTAG OpenSDA requires Freescale Kinetis OSJTAG Drivers. It must be installed to the same directory as MDK-ARM. 
   Download the drivers from www.keil.com/download/docs/408.asp.
 - "P&E Micro" or "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file can be downloaded here: 
 - For more information on OpenSDA, refer to FRDM-K20D50 user manual.
