The 'FlexMemory Config' project is a used for programming the FlexMemory partition information 
which is located in data flash IFR. Memory block can be configured as additional program, data
flash and/or EEPROM. Typically, FlexMemory configuration is executed only once in the lifetime 
of the device. (Applicable for MKxxx 50 Mhz devices with FlexMemory Block)

  CMSIS-DAP:                    Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP
                                configures the followings in data flash IFR:  
                                - The relative sizes of Data Flash size
                                  and EEPROM Backup size within FlexNVM area
                                - The relative size of EEPROM within FlexRAM area
                              (used for production)

  ULINK:                        Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                configures the followings in data flash IFR:  
                                - The relative sizes of Data Flash size
                                  and EEPROM Backup size within FlexNVM area
                                - The relative size of EEPROM within FlexRAM area
                              (used for production)

Perform the following steps to configure the data flash IFR.
  1. Configure the "EEPROM size", "EEPROM Split Factor", and "FlexNVM Partition Code". (MKxx50MhzDataIFR.s)
  2. Build the Target
  3. Click the button LOAD, to download to flash


ULINK note: For using ULINK Debug/Target driver, Samtec FTSH-105-02-F-D or compatible connectors can be added
      to the J6 through-hole debug connector to allow for an external debug cable to be connected.


Selecting "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application:
 1. Start OpenSDA in bootloader mode: Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection whilst pushbutton, SW1 is pressed. 
 2. Drag and drop "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file to the OpenSDA mass storage device. 
 3. Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection.
 
Note:
