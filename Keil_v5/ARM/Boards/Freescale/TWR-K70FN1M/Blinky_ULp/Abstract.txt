The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MK70' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'TWR-K70FN1M' evaluation board populated with
K70FN1M0VMJ12 device, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 20971520 Hz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs (PTA.11,28,29) blink every 1 sec
 - LED's ON/OFF Status is output onto ITM debug port #0
   
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  SWO Trace:                   runs from Internal Flash
                               shows use of ITM output, Exception Trace

  TracePort Trace:             runs from Internal Flash
                               shows use of ITM output, Exception Trace

  TracePort Instruction Trace: runs from Internal Flash
                               shows use of ITM output, Instruction Trace

  Embedded Trace Buffer      : runs from Internal Flash
                               shows use of ITM output, Instruction Trace

- ULINKpro notes
--------------
K70_TracePort.ini enables synchronous 4bit Trace Interface
ETM Trace pins:  TRACECK         PTA5
                 TRACED0..3      PTA6..PTA9    (4 bit trace data)
                 do not use these pins in your application!

K70_TracePort.ini is not required for using the Embedded Trace Buffer.

TWR-K70FN1M notes 
--------------
Remove R138 and place R137 to connect the Trace Clock to the debug connector. 
(This clock is multiplexed with the external USB PHY clock (ULPI_CLK) 
and the USB clock function is the default.)
