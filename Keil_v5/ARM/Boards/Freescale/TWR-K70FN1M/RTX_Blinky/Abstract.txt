The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MK70' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'TWR-K70FN1M' evaluation board populated with
K70FN1M0VMJ12 device, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 50 MHz                                                   

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. 2 LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The RTX_Blinky program is available in different targets:
  ULink-Flash:                     Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  ULink-RAM:                       Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
