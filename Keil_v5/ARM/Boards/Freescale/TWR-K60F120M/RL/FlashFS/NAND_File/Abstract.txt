This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files on the NAND Flash
Memory.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock = 120 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  60 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  30 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  20 MHz
   - USBFS   clock =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - USART2 (on TWR-SER): 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

 - MT29F2G16ABAEAWP NAND Flash Settings:
   - Page Size:   2048 + 64 bytes
   - Block Size:  64 pages
   - Device Size: 2048 blocks


The NAND_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for single target:

MK60FN1M Flash:
    Standalone application for TWR-K60F120M Board using RS232
    serial port as a communication interface.

    Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port using
    HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
    1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.
