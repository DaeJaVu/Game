The SD_Memory project is a demo program for the TWR-K60F120M Tower 
module using a Freescale K60FN1M0VLQ12 Microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock = 120 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  60 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  30 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  20 MHz
   - USBFS   clock =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The SD_Memory program is available for the following target:
MK60:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
         (used for production or target debugging)
         
Note: Jumpers position on the TWR-SER module:
         - J10 = 2-3 shorted => Source 5V from USB (Bus-powered device)
         - J16 = 3-4 shorted => Device Mode (source 5V from VBUS)
