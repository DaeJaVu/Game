The SD_File project is a demo program for the TWR-K60F120M Tower 
module using a Freescale K60FN1M0VLQ12 Microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock = 120 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  60 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  30 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  20 MHz
   - USBFS   clock =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

File manipulation from the target is also available over serial port.

When SW2 button is pressed the USB Memory is unmounted from the PC
and can be accessed from the target over serial port. It allows to 
create, read, copy, delete files and format the card.
Pressing SW2 button again, will re-mount the USB Memory on the PC.

Connect a serial cable to RS232 UART1/3/4 port using HyperTerminal
  at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, No Flow Control.


The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.
The SD_File program is available for the following target:

MK60 RTX:   configured for on-chip Flash ROM
           (used for production or target debugging)
         
Note: Jumpers position on the TWR-SER module:
         - J10 = 2-3 shorted => Source 5V from USB (Bus-powered device)
         - J16 = 3-4 shorted => Device Mode (source 5V from VBUS)
