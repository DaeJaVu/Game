The HID project is a demo program for the TWR-K60F120M Tower 
module using a Freescale K60FN1M0VLQ12 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs
  - 2 BUTTONs (SW1, SW2)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  MK60 RTX:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
            (used for production or target debugging)

Note: Jumpers position on the TWR-SER module:
         - J10 = 2-3 shorted => Source 5V from USB (Bus-powered device)
         - J16 = 3-4 shorted => Device Mode (source 5V from VBUS)        

  SW1 will not work on Kinetis chip revision 0M33Z
  Cause: Port pin PTA19 cannot be used as GPIO if external clock
         is used.
