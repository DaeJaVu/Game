The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MKL46' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'TWR-KL46Z48M' evaluation board populated with
MKL46Z256xxx4 device, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).
It demonstrates the usage of MTB( Micro Trace Buffer).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 48000000 Hz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LEDs(PTA.5,PTA.16) blink every 500 ms 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  ULink-MTB:                     Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   shows use of MTB(Micro Trace Buffer)

  ULinkPro-MTB:                  Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINKPro
                                   shows use of MTB(Micro Trace Buffer)

  CMSIS-DAP-MTB:                 Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP OpenSDA
                                   shows use of MTB(Micro Trace Buffer)


Selecting "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application:
 1. Start OpenSDA in bootloader mode: Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection whilst pushbutton, SW1 is pressed. 
 2. Drag and drop "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file to the OpenSDA mass storage device. 
 3. Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection.
 
Note:
 - For more information on OpenSDA, refer to TWR-KL46Z48M user manual.
 
- MTB(Micro Trace Buffer) Notes
-------------------------------
- DBG_MTB.ini file configures MTB settings, which allows to configure MTB RAM buffer size, buffer position, and flow control.
- MTB allocates user-defined region of the system RAM for storing instruction address change-of-flow data packets.
  Modify MTB position and size to define the used memory region. The position must be a multiple of the buffer size.
  The allocated buffer region cannot be used as application RAM.
