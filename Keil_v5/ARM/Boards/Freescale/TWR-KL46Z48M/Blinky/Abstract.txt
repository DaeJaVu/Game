The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MKL46' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'TWR-KL46Z48M' evaluation board populated with
MKL46Z256xxx4 device, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 48000000 Hz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - Red/Green/Blue LED(PTA.5,PTA.16) blink every 500 ms 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  ULink -Flash:                    Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULink
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  ULink -RAM:                      Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULink
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)

  CMSIS-DAP -Flash:                Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP OpenSDA
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  CMSIS-DAP -RAM:                  Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP OpenSDA
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)


Selecting "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application:
 1. Start OpenSDA in bootloader mode: Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection whilst pushbutton, SW1 is pressed. 
 2. Drag and drop "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file to the OpenSDA mass storage device. 
 3. Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection.
