This is an RL-USB-Host Human Interface Device (HID) usage example.

Board configuration consists of: TWR-ELEV (PRIMARY+SECONDARY) + TWR-SER + 
                                 XTWR-KL25Z48M

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock =  48 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  48 MHz
   - USBFS   clock =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART0 (on TWR-SER): 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

This example shows how to use USB Keyboard as terminal input to 
the device and it uses UART as terminal output.

The Measure example is described in detail in the Getting Started
User's Guide.

The HID_KBD program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

KL25Z48M:   Standalone application for the KL25Z48M Board.

Note: 

      Jumpers position on the XTWR-KL25Z48M module:
         - J1  = on
         - J3  = 1-3 shorted
         - J6  = off
         - J7  = on
         - J8  = 1-2 shorted
         - J9  = on
         - J14 = off
         - J15 = off
         - J17 = on
         - J18 = on
         - J19 = on
         - J20 = on
         - J21 = on
         - J23 = on
         - J24 = on

Important Note !!! :
      Power should be provided through J22 mini USB connector on the 
      XTWR-KL25Z48M board and J13 micro USB connector on the XTWR-KL25Z48M 
      board is used for the USB Host functionality.
