The HID project is a demo program for the XTWR-KL25Z48M Tower
module using a Freescale MKL25Z Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 2 LEDs
  - 2 BUTTONs (SW2, SW3)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  KL25Z48M:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
            (used for production or target debugging)

Note: 

      Jumpers position on the XTWR-KL25Z48M module:
         - J1  = on
         - J3  = 1-3 shorted
         - J6  = off
         - J7  = on
         - J8  = 1-2 shorted
         - J9  = on
         - J14 = off
         - J15 = off
         - J17 = on
         - J18 = on
         - J19 = on
         - J20 = on
         - J21 = on
         - J23 = on
         - J24 = on

Important Note !!! :
      Power should be provided through J22 mini USB connector on the 
      XTWR-KL25Z48M board and J13 micro USB connector on the XTWR-KL25Z48M 
      board is used for the USB device functionality.
