The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MK60' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'TWR-K60N512' evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 96 MHz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs (PTA.11,28,29) blink every 250 ms 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  K60N512 - Flash:                 populated with MK60N512VMD100 device
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  K60N512 - RAM:                   populated with MK60N512VMD100 device
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)
