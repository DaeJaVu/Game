This is a HTTP File Upload example. It allows you to upload
files to SD Card from a Web browser.

Use this example to connect TWR-K60N512 Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect TWR-K60N512 to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your web browser and enter the
address http://twr_k60n512/ or http://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

The HTTP_upload example is available for one target:

K60N512:   Standalone (no RTX Kernel) application.
           Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.


Jumper settings:
  TWR-K60N512 board, Rev B:
    J6 must connect pins 2 and 3 (CLKIN0 is clock source)

  TWR-SER board, Rev D:
    J3 must connect pins 2 and 3 (Connect CLOCKIN0 to OSC)


Note:
  SW1 will not work on Kinetis chip revision 0M33Z
  Cause: Port pin PTA19 cannot be used as GPIO if external clock
         is used.
