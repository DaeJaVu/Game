This is a FTP Server example. It allows you to manage files
on SD Card from PC using FTP client.

Use this example to connect TWR-K60N512 Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect TWR-K60N512
Board to PC directly over a crosslink network cable. In this
case configure a PC to use a static IP address 192.168.0.1 and
disable the 'Dynamic Host Configuration' in Net_Config.c
configuration file. The default static IP address of
TWR-K60N512 is then 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your ftp client and enter the
address ftp://twr_k60n512/ or ftp://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

The FTP_demo example is available for several targets:

K60N512:
    Standalone application for Freescale TWR-K60N512 Board.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

K60N512 Debug:
    Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
    in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    Connect a serial cable to RS232 port to view output
    messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
    8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.


Jumper settings:
  TWR-K60N512 board, Rev B:
    J6 must connect pins 2 and 3 (CLKIN0 is clock source)

  TWR-SER board, Rev D:
    J3 must connect pins 2 and 3 (Connect CLOCKIN0 to OSC)


Note:
  SW1 will not work on Kinetis chip revision 0M33Z
  Cause: Port pin PTA19 cannot be used as GPIO if external clock
         is used.
