This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Freescale TWR-K60N512 Evaluation Board' with 
'Freescale Kinetis MK60N512' microcontroller.

 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock =  96 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  48 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  48 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  24 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - CAN1:   500 kbits

Example functionality:
 - send converted analog value in first byte in message 
   every 1 second (ID = 0x21)
 - display higher 4 bits of received byte in hexadecimal 
   representation on 4 LEDs (ID = 0x21)

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the values on LEDs change accordingly.

Note: 
      Jumpers position on the TWR-SER module:
         - J5  = 1-2  shorted
                 3-4  shorted
                 5-6  shorted
                 7-8  shorted
                 9-10 shorted
      J7 pin 1 is CANH, J7 pin 3 is CANL

The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for one target:

K60N512:   Standalone application for the K60N512 Board.
