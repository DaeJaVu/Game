The HID project is a demo program for the TWR-K60N512 Tower  
module using a Freescale MK60N512VMD100  Microcontroller.

Example functionality: 
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core clock     = 96MHz 
   - BusClock       = 48MHz 
   - FlexBus        = 48MHz 
   - Flash clock    = 24MHz
   
It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.
