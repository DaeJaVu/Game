The Memory project is a demo program for the TWR-K60N512 Board
using MK60N512VMD100 Microcontroller.

Example functionality:
  
  - Clock settings:
    - XTAL          =  50 MHz
    - CPU Clock     =  96 MHz
    - USB Clock     =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

MK60N512 Flash:  Configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                (used for production or target debugging)
