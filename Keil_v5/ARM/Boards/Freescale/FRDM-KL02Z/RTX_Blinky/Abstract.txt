The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MKL02' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'FRDM-KL02Z' evaluation board populated with
MKL02Z32xxx4 device, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 47970000 Hz                                                   

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. LED is blinking in Red/Green/Blue simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The RTX_Blinky program is available in different targets:
  CMSIS-DAP -Flash:                Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP OpenSDA
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  ULink -Flash:                    Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULink
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)


Selecting "P&E Micro" or "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application:
 1. Start OpenSDA in bootloader mode: Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection whilst pushbutton, SW1 is pressed. 
 2. Drag and drop "P&E Micro" or "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file to the OpenSDA mass storage device. 
 3. Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection.
 
Note:
 - P&E Micro OpenSDA requires Freescale Kinetis OSJTAG Drivers V1.06 or higher. It must be 
   installed to the same directory as MDK-ARM. Download the drivers from www.keil.com/download/docs/408.asp.
 - "P&E Micro" or "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file can be downloaded here: 
 - For more information on OpenSDA, refer to FRDM-KL25Z user manual.
