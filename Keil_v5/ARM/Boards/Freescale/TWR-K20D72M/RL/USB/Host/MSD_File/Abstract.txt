This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Board configuration consists of: TWR-ELEV (PRIMARY+SECONDARY) + TWR-SER + 
                                 TWR-K20D72M

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock =  48 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  48 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  24 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  24 MHz
   - USBFS   clock =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART1 (on TWR-SER): 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

K20D72M:   Standalone application for the K20D72M Board.

Note: 

      Jumpers position on the TWR-K20D72M module:
         - J6  = on          => Connect on board VBRD for MCU power supply
         - J10 = off         => Disconnect on board VBRD for MCU power supply
         - J15 = off         => Debugger mode
         - J16 = 1-2 shorted => 5V Power from OSBDM USB powers LDO regulator
                 6-8 shorted => VBUS signal from elevator connector connects to
                                VREGIN to allow USB operation with complete tower kit
         - J17 = 3-5 shorted => Board power from 3.3V regulator
         - J18 = off         => Disconnect USB 3.3V regualtor output to MCU_PWR
         - J20 = on          => Connect over-current signal on USB power IC MIC-2026 
                                to PTC8
         - J27 = on          => Enable POTENTIOMETER to ADC1_DM0

      Jumpers position on the TWR-SER module:
         - J10 = 1-2 shorted => Supply 5V on USB Connector (Host Mode)
         - J16 = 1-2 shorted => Host Mode (supply 5V to VBUS)
