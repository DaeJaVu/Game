The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MK40' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'TWR-K40X256' evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 48 MHz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs (PTC.7..9) blink every 250 ms 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  K40X256 - Flash:                 populated with MK40X256VMD100 device
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  K40X256 - RAM:                   populated with MK40X256VMD100 device
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)
