The HID project is a demo program for the TWR-K40X256 Tower  
module using a Freescale MK40x256  Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs
  - 1 BUTTONs (SW6)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  MK40X256:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
            (used for production or target debugging)
               
Note: USB MINIAB connector on TWR-SER module is used
      Jumpers position on the TWR-SER module:
         - J10 = 2-3 shorted => Source 5V from USB (Bus-powered device)
         - J16 = 3-4 shorted => Device Mode (source 5V from VBUS)
