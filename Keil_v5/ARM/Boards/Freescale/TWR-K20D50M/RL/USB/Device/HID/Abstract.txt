The HID project is a demo program for the TWR-K20D50M Tower
module using a Freescale MK20N5 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 2 LEDs
  - 2 BUTTONs (SW1, SW2)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  MK20D50M:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
            (used for production or target debugging)

Note: USB MICROAB  J31 connector on TWR-K20D50M
      processor module is used.
