This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Board configuration consists of: only TWR-K20D50M

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock =  48 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  48 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  24 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  24 MHz
   - USBFS   clock =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - ITM

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

K20D50M:   Standalone application for the K20D50M Board.

Note: 

      Jumpers position on the TWR-K20D50M module: 
         - J11 = off         => Disable Yellow LED driving by PTC9
         - J15 = 1-2 shorted => Potentiometer Enable (ADC0_DM3)
         - J23 = 1-2 shorted => VDDA to MCU_PWR
         - J24 = off         => Disconnect target power of JTAG connector
         - J25 = 1-2 shorted => VBRD to MCU_PWR
         - J26 = 1-2 shorted => PTC9 control of K20 USB ENA
         - J29 = 3-5 shorted => P3.3V_REG powers VBRD(MCU_PWR)
         - J29 = 3-5 shorted => P3.3V_REG powers VBRD(MCU_PWR)
         - J30 = 1-2 shorted => Regulator powered by OSJTAG USB
                 5-6 shorted => K20 USB power the K20 Regulator
         - J32 = 1-2 shorted => Enable USB Flag
         - J34 = off         => OSJTAG mode
         - J35 = 1-2 shorted
         - J36 = 1-2 shorted

      Power should be provided through J12 mini USB connector on the 
      TWR-K20D50M board and J31 micro USB connector on the TWR-K20D50M 
      board is used for the USB Host functionality.
