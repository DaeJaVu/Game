This program is an SNMP Agent demo example. It shows how to 
use a Simple Network Management Protocol to control the
embedded system.

Use this example to connect TWR-K70F120M Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect TWR-K70F120M Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

To test this example, run windows application 'SNMPTest.exe' and
type in the ip address of your Embedded SNMP Agent and click
'Connect'. When connected, you can change the LCD text on
the target, control the onboard LED diodes and monitor the
state of onboard pushbuttons.

The SNMP_demo example is available for several targets:

MK70F120M:
    Standalone application for TWR-K70F120M Board.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

MK70F120M Debug:
    Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
    in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    Connect a serial cable to RS232 port to view output
    messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
    8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.


Jumper settings:
  TWR-K70F120M board:
    J18 must connect pins 2 and 3 (CLKIN0 is clock source)

  TWR-SER board, Rev D:
    J3 must connect pins 2 and 3 (Connect CLOCKIN0 to OSC)
