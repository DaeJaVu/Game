The 'Demo' project is a simple demonstration program for Freescale Kinetis 'MK70' 
series microcontroller using the Freescale 'TWR-K70F120M' evaluation board 
populated with the 'K70FN1M0VMJ12' device, 
compliant to the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Board configuration consists of: TWR-ELEV (PRIMARY+SECONDARY) + TWR-SER + 
                                 TWR-K70F120M

System Settings:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock = 120 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  60 MHz
   - FlexBus clock =  30 MHz
   - Flash   clock =  20 MHz
 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - USART2 (on TWR-SER): 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

Example functionality:
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 1 LED blinks with speed determined by ADC value (potentiometer position)
 - 2 LEDs show two buttons state
 - ADC value is output every 1 second to the Communication Interface

The Demo program is available for one target:

K70F120M:   Standalone application for the K70F120M Board.
