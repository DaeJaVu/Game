The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale Kinetis 'MK70' 
series microcontroller using the Freescale 'TWR-K70F120M' evaluation board 
populated with the 'K70FN1M0VMJ12' device, 
compliant to the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock = 120 MHz
   - Bus     clock =  60 MHz
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 4 LEDs (PTA11,PTA28,PTA29,PTA10) blink every 500 ms (250 ms on, 250 ms off) 

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  ULink-Flash:                     Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  ULink-RAM:                       Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)

  ULink- Ext SDRAM:               Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK
                                   runs from external SDRAM. (Micron MT47H64M16HR-25)
                                  (used for target debugging)

  UlinkPro-Flash:                  Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINKPro
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
