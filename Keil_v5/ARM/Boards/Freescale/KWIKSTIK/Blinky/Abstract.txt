The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Freescale 'MK40' series 
microcontroller using Freescale 'KWIKSTIK' evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - 4 Mhz EXternal Oscillator
 - Core Clock runs at 24 MHz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - JLink and Freescale Logo on the SLCD, turns on/off every 3 seconds  

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  JLink - Flash:                 Debug/Target Driver is configured as JLink
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  JLink - RAM:                   Debug/Target Driver is configured as JLink
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)
