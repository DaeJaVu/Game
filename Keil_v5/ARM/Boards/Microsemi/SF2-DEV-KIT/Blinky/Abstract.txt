The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Actel 'M2S050T' microcontroller using Microsemi 'SF2 Dev Kit' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  50 MHz
   - CPU Clock  = 100 MHz

 - 8 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if any Button (SW1..SW5) is pressed all LEDs are lit.
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port UART1 
   UART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Cortex-M3 Flash: runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (used for target debugging)

  Cortex-M3 SRAM:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Note:
  This Example is created using Microsemi Libero® system-on-chip (SoC) software toolset.
