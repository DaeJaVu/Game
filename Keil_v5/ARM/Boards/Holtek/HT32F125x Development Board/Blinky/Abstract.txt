The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the Holtek 'HT32F1253' 
microcontroller using Holtek 'HT32F125x' Development Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLKC   = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = HCLKC/8 =  9.00 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in IRQ mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART 
   - USART settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  HT32F1253 Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  HT32F1253 OPT:    HT32F1253 with Flash Options
                    (used for programming, Sets FLASH options)

  HT32F1253 RAM:    configured for on-chip RAM
                    (used for target debugging)

  HT32F1253 SWO:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip and is
                    configured for SWO 
                    (USART ouput is redirected to SWO, open window "Debug (printf) Viewer")
