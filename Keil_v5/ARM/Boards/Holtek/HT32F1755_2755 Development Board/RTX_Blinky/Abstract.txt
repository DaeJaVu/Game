The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
Holtek 'HT32F1755' microcontroller using Holtek 'HT32F1755/2755 
Development Board', compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLKC   = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  HT32F1755 Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  HT32F1755 RAM:    configured for on-chip RAM
                    (used for target debugging)
