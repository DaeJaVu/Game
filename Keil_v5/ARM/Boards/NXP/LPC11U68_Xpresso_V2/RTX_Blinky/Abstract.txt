The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
NXP 'LPC11U68' microcontroller using NXP 'LPC11U68 Xpresso V2' Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  48 MHz


The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available for target:

  LPC11U68 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash
                   (used for production or target debugging)
