The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
NXP 'LPC11U68' microcontroller using NXP 'LPC11U68 Xpresso V2' Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  48 MHz


 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC11U68 RAM:    runs from Internal Flash
                   (used for target debugging)

  LPC11U68 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash
                   (used for production or target debugging)
