The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the ST 'STM32F100ZE' using ST 'STM32100E-EVAL' 
Evaluation Board and and is compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.30).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =   8 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =  24 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor driver.
LEDs are blinking simulating the activity of the clock task.

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:


  STM32100E-EVAL RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip, GLCD disabled
                         (used for target debugging)

  STM32100E-EVAL Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                         (used for production or target debugging)
