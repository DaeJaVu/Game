The LCD_Blinky project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F100ZE' 
microcontroller using ST 'STM32100E-EVAL' evaluation board and 
demonstrating interrupt functionality and display to graphic LCD.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.30).


Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  8 MHz
   - HCLK  = 24 MHz

 - Displays rotating ARM 3D logo, each picture is displayed every 
   150 ms
 - 4 LEDs blink with speed of 50 ms, determined by SysTick Timer
   working in interrupt mode


 
The LCD_Blinky program is available for target:
  STM32100E-EVAL Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                        (used for production or target debugging)

Note:
  Do NOT rebuild if you are using uVision Evaluation Version!
