The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F100ZE'
using ST 'STM32100E-EVAL' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
interrupt functionality, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.30).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =   8 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =  24 MHz

 - LED blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
   - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - colour GLCD display shows
   - init message
   - AD value and bargraph (depending on potentiometer position)
   - buttons and joystick status
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART2 
   - USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 - AD is used with DMA or IRQ (see file Blinky.c)
   AD settings: 12 bit resolution



The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32100E-EVAL RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip, GLCD disabled
                         (used for target debugging)

  STM32100E-EVAL Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                         (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32100E-EVAL Trace:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                         (configured for Exception trace & SWO )
