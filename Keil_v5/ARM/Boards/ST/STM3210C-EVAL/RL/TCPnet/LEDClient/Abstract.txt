This program is a LEDSwitch Client example. It is used to send commands
to a LEDSwitch Server connected on the same LAN. The sending commands 
control LED diodes on remote Server, how they are switched on or off.

In order to run this example, you need to set the network parameters
to match your local area network.

To test this example, run application LEDSwitch on one STM3210C-EVAL
board and Client application on another ST STM3210C-EVAL board. 
The Client application sends the value of P2 to LEDSwitch 
application over TCP or UDP.

NOTE: IP address and MAC address of this example must be set different
      from IP and MAC addressess on LEDSwitch Server.

The Client example is available for several targets:

STM3210C:       Standalone application for STM3210C-EVAL Board.
                Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

STM3210C Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
                in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
                Connect a serial cable to RS232 USART2 port to view
                output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
                8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

Note: jumper positions 
 - JP4: 1-2  enable XTAL clock for the PHY
 - other jumpers default position
