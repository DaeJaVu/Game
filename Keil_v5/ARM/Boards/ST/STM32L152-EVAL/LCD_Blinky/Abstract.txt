The LCD_Blinky project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32L152VB' 
microcontroller using ST 'STM32L152-EVAL' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           32.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 32.00 MHz

 - ARM logo rotates on GLCD
 - potentiometer position is displayed as bargraph on  GLCD
 - status of buttons and joystick are displayed on GLCD
 - 4 LEDs blink

Jumper setting: 
    JP18:  closed    (LED3)
    JP19:  closed    (LED4)


 
The LCD_Blinky program is available for target:

  STM32L152 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)


Note:
  Do NOT rebuild if you are using uVision Evaluation Version!
