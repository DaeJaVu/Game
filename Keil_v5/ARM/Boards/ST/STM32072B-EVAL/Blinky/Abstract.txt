The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for
ST 'STM32F072RB (STM32F052RB)' microcontroller using ST 'STM32072B-EVAL' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           48.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 48.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LED blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - colour LCD display shows init message and bargraph depending on potentiometer position
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART2
   USART2 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F072 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (used for target debugging)

  STM32F072 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)
