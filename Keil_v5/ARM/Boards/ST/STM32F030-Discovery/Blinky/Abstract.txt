The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
ST 'STM32F030R8' microcontroller using ST 'STM32F030-Discovery' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - SYSCLK  =           48.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 48.00 MHz

 - 2 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if Button USER is pressed all LEDs are lit.



The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F030 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F030 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
