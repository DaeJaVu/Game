The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
ST 'STM32F407Z' microcontroller using ST 'STM3240G-EVAL' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =          168.00 MHz


The example simulates a step-motor driver.
Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and CW rotation direction.


The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

  STM32F407 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F407 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)
