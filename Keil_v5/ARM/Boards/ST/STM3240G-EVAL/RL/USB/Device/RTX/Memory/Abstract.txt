The Memory project is a demo program for the ST STM3240G-EVAL Board
using a ST STM32F407 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  STM3240_HS RTX:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM, RTX version
  STM3240_FS RTX:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM, RTX version
                      (used for production or target debugging)
