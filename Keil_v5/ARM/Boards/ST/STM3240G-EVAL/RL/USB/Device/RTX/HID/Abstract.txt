The HID project is a demo program for the ST STM3240G-Eval Board
using a ST STM32F407  Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs    (LED1..4)
  - 3 BUTTONs (Wakeup, Tamper, Key)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  STM32F407 HS RTX:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM, RTX version
  STM32F407 FS RTX:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM, RTX, version
                      (used for production or target debugging)
