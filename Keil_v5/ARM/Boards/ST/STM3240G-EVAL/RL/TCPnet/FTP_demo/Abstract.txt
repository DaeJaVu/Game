This is a FTP Server example. It allows you to manage files
on SD Card from PC using FTP client.

Use this example to connect STM3240G-EVAL Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect STM3240G-EVAL Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your ftp client and enter the
address ftp://stm3240g-eval/ or ftp://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

The FTP_demo example is available for several targets:

STM32F407:
    Standalone application for ST STM3240G-EVAL Board.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

STM32F407 Debug:
    Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
    in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    Debug output is redirected to ITM port. Start Debug
    Session and open Debug Viewer to view output messages.


Jumper settings:
  JP5  must: - Connect pins 1 and 2 to enable external crystal for PHY clock
  JP6  must: - Connect pins 2 and 3 for MII interface
  JP8  must: - Be open for MII interface
  JP22 must: - Be open to enable SD card

Notes:
  - SD card data line is shared with RS232 line, JP22 must be set to open
    to enable MicroSD card
