This program is a Telnet Server example. It shows how to build a
simple IP based command line interface. 

Use this example to connect STM3240G-EVAL Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect STM3240G-EVAL Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

This example is configured to run in 3 simultaneous sessions.
This means that 3 Telnet Clients can be connected to Telnet Server
at the same time. This can be either 3 different PC computers or a
single PC computer running 3 instances of Telnet Client. 

To test this example you need to run a Telnet client on your PC.
If you do not have installed a special Telnet Client software on your
PC, you can run the Windows telnet client from a Console Window.

From the console window type:  telnet stm3240g-eval

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

You can change the password at runtime with a command 'passw'

At Telnet server command prompt type 'help' to display
available commands or 'bye' to disconnect.

You can modify the tnet_process_cmd() function, which is called to
process a command when a Enter key is pressed. It is located in 
Telnet_uif.c - telnet user interface module.

The Telnet_demo example is available for several targets:

STM32F407:
    Standalone application for STM3240G-EVAL Board.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

STM32F407 Debug:
    Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
    in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    Connect a serial cable to RS232 USART port to view
    output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
    8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.


Jumper settings:
  JP5  must: - Connect pins 1 and 2 to enable external crystal for PHY clock
  JP6  must: - Connect pins 2 and 3 for MII interface
  JP8  must: - Be open for MII interface
  JP22 must: - Connect pins 1 and 2 to enable USART port
