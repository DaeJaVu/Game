The LCD_Blinky project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32L152ZD' 
microcontroller using ST 'STM32L152D-EVAL' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           32.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 32.00 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 4 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - colour GLCD display shows
   - init message
   - AD value and bargraph (depending on potentiometer position)
 - LCD displays a rotating text
 - AD conversion is done in DMA mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART3 
   - USART3 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32L152 RAM:       configured for Internal RAM located on chip
                      (used for target debugging)

  STM32L152 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32L152 OPT:      configured for on-chip Flash + Options Bytes
                      (used for programming)

  STM32L152 Trace:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      Shows exception trace, Output is redirected to SWO
