The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the ST 'STM32L152ZD' microcontroller using ST 'STM32L152D-EVAL' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           32.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 32.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.



The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32L152 RAM:    configured for Internal RAM located on chip
                    (used for target debugging)

  STM32L152 Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash
                    (used for production or target debugging)
