This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files on the NAND Flash
Memory.


The NAND_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

STM3220F-EVAL:
    Standalone application for STM3220F-EVAL Board using ITM
    debug port as a communication interface.

    Download application into target, start debug session (Ctrl + F5),
    open Debug (printf) Viewer and start code execution - press Run (F5).



Example properties:

  - Clock settings:
    - XTAL        =  25 MHz
    - CPU Clock   = 120 MHz


Samsung KFG1216U2A 512Mbit (64MB) OneNAND Configuration:

  - Page size:            2048 + 64 bytes
  - Pages per block:      64
  - Number of blocks:     512


Notes:
  - JP 14, JP15 must be keept on open for OneNAND application.
  - OneNAND manages ECC in hardware
