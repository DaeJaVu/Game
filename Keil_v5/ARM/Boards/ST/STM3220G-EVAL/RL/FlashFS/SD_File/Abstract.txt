This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card. 

The SD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

STM3220G-EVAL:
    Standalone application for STM3220G-EVAL Board using ITM
    debug port as a communication interface.

    Download application into target, start debug session (Ctrl + F5),
    open Debug (printf) Viewer and start code execution - press Run (F5).
           
Example properties:

  - Clock settings:
    - XTAL        =  25 MHz
    - CPU Clock   = 120 MHz
    
Notes:
  - SD card data line is shared with RS232 line, JP22 must be set to open
    to enable MicroSD card

  - This example also works on the STM3220F-EVAL board.
