This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'ST STM3220G-EVAL' Evaluation Board with 
'ST STM32F207IGT6' microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL               =  25 MHz
   - CPUCLK             = 120 MHz
   - APB1 CLK = CAN CLK =  30 MHz

 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN 1 controller every 1 second
 - receive CAN message on CAN 1 controller
 - display lower 4-bit of received byte values on 4 LEDs
   CAN 1 controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the values on LEDs change accordingly.

The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for two targets:

STM3220G-EVAL:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
               (used for production or target debugging)

STM3220F-EVAL:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
               (used for production or target debugging)


STM3220G-EVAL Notes:
  - Jumpers Settings needed for example to work:
    JP7:  shorted 1-2, JP10: shorted 2-3, JP3: shorted 2-3

  - PD0 and PB5 are disconnected from the CAN transceiver and used for 
    FSMC and USB_OTG_HS when jumper JP10 is not fitted (default setting).


STM3220F-EVAL Notes:
  - Jumpers Settings needed for example to work:
    JP7:  shorted 1-2, JP10: closed, JP11: closed
    JP12: shorted 1-2, JP14: closed, JP15: closed
    JP23: closed
  - CAN1_TX is connected to PD1  and all peripherals connected to FSMC 
    (LCD, PSRAM, OneNAND) are disabled when JP14 is closed
  - CAN1_RX is connected to PD0  and all peripherals connected to FSMC 
    (LCD, PSRAM, OneNAND) are disabled when JP15 is closed
