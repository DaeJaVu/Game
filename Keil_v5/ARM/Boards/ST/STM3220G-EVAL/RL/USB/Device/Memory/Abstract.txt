The Memory project is a demo program for the ST STM3220G-EVAL 
Board using a ST STM32F207 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  STM3220G HS:      configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  STM3220G FS:      configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
