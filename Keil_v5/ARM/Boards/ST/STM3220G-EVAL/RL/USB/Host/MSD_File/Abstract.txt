This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  25 MHz
   - CPUCLK = 120 MHz
   - USBCLK =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - USART3: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

STM3220G-EVAL: Standalone application for ST STM3220G-EVAL Board using
           OTG_FS and OTG_HS as USB Ports and COM port as a communication interface.

Notes:   - Cable necessary for connecting USB memory device should have 
           USB micro-A plug connector on one side and Standard USB Type-A 
           receptacle connector on the other side.
         - Jumper JP22 (1-2) must be closed for UART
