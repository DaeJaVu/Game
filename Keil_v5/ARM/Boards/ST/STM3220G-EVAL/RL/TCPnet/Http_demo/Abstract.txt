This is a HTTP Server example. It shows you how to use the
Web Server CGI interface as well. 

Use this example to connect STM3220G-EVAL Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect STM3220G-EVAL Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.101

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

The WEB pages are included into the project under HTTP Files 
group. You can simply add or remove a page or image. Web files
which are compiled into the project are added to the 'Web.inp'
Web Converter input file.

To test this example, open your web browser and enter the 
address http://stm3220g-eval/ or http://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

You can change the password at runtime on page 'system'

The HTTP_demo example is available for several targets:

STM3220G-EVAL:
    Standalone (no RTX Kernel) application.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

STM3220G-EVAL Debug:
    Standalone (no RTX Kernel) with debug output.
    Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c configuration file.
    Debug output is redirected to USART serial port.
    Connect a serial cable to RS232 USART port to view
    output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
    8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

STM3220G-EVAL RTX:
    The same example configured for RTX Kernel.


Jumper settings:
  JP5  must: - Connect pins 1 and 2 to enable external crystal for PHY clock
  JP6  must: - Connect pins 2 and 3 for MII interface
  JP8  must: - Be open for MII interface
  JP22 must: - Connect pins 1 and 2 to enable USART port

Note:
  This example, except potentiometer, also works on the STM3220F-EVAL board.
