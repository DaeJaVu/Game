This program is an SNMP Agent demo example. It shows how to 
use a Simple Network Management Protocol to control the
embedded system.

Use this example to connect STM3220G-EVAL Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect STM3220G-EVAL Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

To test this example, run windows application 'SNMPTest.exe' and
type in the ip address of your Embedded SNMP Agent and click
'Connect'. When connected, you can change the LCD text on
the target, control the onboard LED diodes and monitor the
state of onboard pushbuttons.

The SNMP_demo example is available for several targets:

STM3220G-EVAL:
    Standalone application for ST STM3220G-EVAL Board.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

STM3220G-EVAL Debug:
    Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
    in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    Connect a serial cable to RS232 USART port to view
    output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
    8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.


Jumper settings:
  JP5  must: - Connect pins 1 and 2 to enable external crystal for PHY clock
  JP6  must: - Connect pins 2 and 3 for MII interface
  JP8  must: - Be open for MII interface
  JP22 must: - Connect pins 1 and 2 to enable USART port   

Note:
  This example also works on the STM3220F-EVAL board.
