This is a FTP Server example. It allows you to manage files
on SD Card from PC using FTP client.

Use this example to connect STM3220G-EVAL Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect STM3220G-EVAL
Board to PC directly over a crosslink network cable. In this
case configure a PC to use a static IP address 192.168.0.1 and
disable the 'Dynamic Host Configuration' in Net_Config.c
configuration file. The default static IP address of
STM3220G-EVAL is then 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your ftp client and enter the
address ftp://stm3220g-eval/ or ftp://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

The FTP_demo example is available for several targets:

STM3220G-EVAL:
    Standalone application for ST STM3220G-EVAL Board.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

STM3220G-EVAL Debug:
    Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
    in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    Debug output is redirected to ITM port. Start Debug
    Session and open Debug Viewer to view output messages.


Jumper settings:
  JP5  must: - Connect pins 1 and 2 to enable external crystal for PHY clock
  JP6  must: - Connect pins 2 and 3 for MII interface
  JP8  must: - Be open for MII interface
  JP22 must: - Be open to enable SD card

Note:
  This example also works on the STM3220F-EVAL board.
