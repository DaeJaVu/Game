This is a simple RTX Kernel based example which simulates
the step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating
the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

  STM32F207 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F207 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)

Note:
  This example also works on the STM3220F-EVAL board.
