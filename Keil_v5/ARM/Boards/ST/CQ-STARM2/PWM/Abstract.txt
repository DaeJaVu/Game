The PWM project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32F103VB' 
microcontroller using CQ-STARM2 Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - TIM3 is running at  100Hz.
   LED  is dimmed using the PWM function of TIM3 channel1


The PWM program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
