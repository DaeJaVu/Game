The Timer project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32F103VB' 
microcontroller using CQ-STARM2, CQ-STARM BaseBoard, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - Timer TIM1 is configured to generate an interrupt every 10 ms
 - displays the seconds on 7 segment display.
 

The Timer program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
