The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
ST 'STM32F429ZI' microcontroller using ST 'STM32F429I-Discovery' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =             8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           180.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 180.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LEDs are blinking with speed depending on SysTick timer interrupt period
 - colour GLCD display shows
   - init message
   - Button status
   - LED status


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F429 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)

  STM32F429 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F429 OPT:      STM32F429 with Flash Options Bytes
                      (used for programming)
