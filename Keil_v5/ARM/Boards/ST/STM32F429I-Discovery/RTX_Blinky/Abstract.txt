The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
ST 'STM32F429ZI' microcontroller using ST 'STM32F429I-Discovery' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =             8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           180.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 180.00 MHz

The example simulates a step-motor driver.

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F429 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)

  STM32F429 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
