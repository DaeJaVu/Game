The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
the ST 'STM32F303VC' microcontroller using ST 'STM32F3-Discovery'
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL (ST-Link) =    8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK         =   72.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F303 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F303 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
