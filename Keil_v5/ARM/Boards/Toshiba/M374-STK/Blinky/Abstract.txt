The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Toshiba 'TMPM374FWUG' 
microcontroller using Toshiba 'M374-STK' evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  10 MHz
   - CCLK  =  80 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 4 LEDs blink with speed of 200ms
 - "hello World" is output onto serial port SC0 
 - SC0 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  TMPM374 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (used for production or target debugging)

  TMPM374 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                  (used for target debugging)

  TMPM374 SWO:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (configured SWO and exception trace)
