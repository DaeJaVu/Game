The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
Toshiba 'TMPM374FWUG' microcontroller using Toshiba 'M374-STK' 
evaluation board and is compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  10 MHz
   - CCLK  =  80 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  TMPM374 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (used for production or target debugging)
