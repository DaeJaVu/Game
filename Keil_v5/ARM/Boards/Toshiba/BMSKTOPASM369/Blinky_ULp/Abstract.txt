The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for the Toshiba 'TMPM369' 
microcontroller using Toshiba BMSKTOPASM369 evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

It demonstrates the use of ULINKpro Debugger.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  16 MHz
   - PLL        =  80 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  80 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on light sensor
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto ITM debug port #0  


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SWO Trace:                 runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace

  TracePort Trace:           runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace

  TracePort IntructionTrace: runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of Instruction Trace
					         use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"


ULINKpro notes
--------------
TMPM369_TPIU.ini enables TPIU Interfcace. 
                 TPIU signals are available on the pins hosting them. 
Trace pins:  TRACECLK        PA.6
             TRACEDATA0..3   PB.0..PB.1, PA.6..PA.7    (4 bit trace data)
             do not use these pins in your application!

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).
