The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for the Toshiba 'TMPM369' 
microcontroller using Toshiba BMSKTOPASM369 evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  16 MHz
   - PLL        =  80 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  80 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on light sensor
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port UART1 (SC0) 
 - UART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 - example starts after pressing joystick


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  TMPM369 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  TMPM369 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
