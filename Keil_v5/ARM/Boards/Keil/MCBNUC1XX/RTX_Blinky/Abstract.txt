The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the Nuvoton 'NUC140VE' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBNUC1XX' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - CCLK  =  22 MHz (IRC22M)

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  NUC140 Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash
                 (used for production or target debugging)
