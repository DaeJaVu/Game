The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the Nuvoton 'NUC140VE' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBNUC1XX' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - CCLK  =  22 MHz (IRC22M)

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in IRQ mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  NUC140 Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash
                 (used for production or target debugging)
