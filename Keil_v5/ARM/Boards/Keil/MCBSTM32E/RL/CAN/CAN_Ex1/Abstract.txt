This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Keil MCBSTM32E Evaluation Board' with 
'ST STM32F103ZET6' microcontroller.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
 - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
 - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

Example functionality:
 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN controller every 1 second
 - display received and transmitted byte values on LCD display
   CAN controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver and how 
to simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the values on LCD display change accordingly.


The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for several targets:

Simulator:    configured for software Simulator

STM32 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
              (used for production or target debugging)


Notes:      
  - to use this example on real CAN network remove 
    CAN_hw_testmode line from CAN_Ex1.c file
