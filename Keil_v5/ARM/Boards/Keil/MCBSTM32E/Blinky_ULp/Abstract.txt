The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the STM 'STM32F103ZE' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32E' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

It demonstrates the use of ULINKpro Debugger.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
 - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
 - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
 - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
 - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
 - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz


Example functionality:                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto ITM debug port #0  


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:                 configured for uVision Simulator

  SWO Trace:                 runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
					         use connector "Trace" or "JTAG"

  TracePort Trace:           runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
					         use connector "Trace"

  TracePort IntructionTrace: runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of Instruction Trace
					         use connector "Trace"


ULINKpro notes
--------------
STM32_TP.ini enables synchronous 4bit Trace Interface
ETM Trace pins:  TRACECK         PE2
                 TRACED0..3      PE3..PE6    (4 bit trace data)
                 do not use these pins in your application!

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).
