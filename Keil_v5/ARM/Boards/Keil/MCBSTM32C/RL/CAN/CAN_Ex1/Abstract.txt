This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Keil MCBSTM32C' Evaluation Board with 
'ST STM32F107VCT6' microcontroller.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL    =               25.00 MHz
 - PLL3    = (XTAL/5)*10 = 50.00 MHz
 - PLL2    = (XTAL/5)* 8 = 40.00 MHz
 - PLL1    = (PLL2/5)* 9 = 72.00 MHz
 - SYSCLK  = PLL1        = 72.00 MHz
 - HCLK    = SYSCLK      = 72.00 MHz
 - PCLK1   = HCLK/2      = 36.00 MHz
 - PCLK2   = HCLK        = 72.00 MHz
 - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6     = 12.00 MHz
 - SYSTICK = HCLK/2      = 36.00 MHz

Example functionality:
 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN 2 controller every 1 second
 - receive CAN message on CAN 1 controller
 - display received and transmitted byte values on 
   Graphical LCD display
   CAN 1 controller speed: 500 kbits
   CAN 2 controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver and how 
to simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the values on LCD display change accordingly.

The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for target:

STM32 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
              (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:      
  - To see the example functionality on hardware, loopback has 
    to be connected between CAN1 and CAN2 (pins 7 on both DB-9 
    headers shorted, and pins 2 on both DB-9 headers shorted)
