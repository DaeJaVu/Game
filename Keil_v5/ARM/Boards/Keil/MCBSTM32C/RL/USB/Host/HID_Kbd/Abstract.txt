Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  25 MHz
   - PLL1   =  72 MHz
   - PLL2   =  40 MHz
   - PLL3   =  50 MHz
   - SYSCLK =  72 MHz
   - USBCLK =  48 MHz

This example shows how to use USB Keyboard as terminal input to 
the device and it uses Graphic LCD as terminal output.

The Measure example is described in detail in the Getting Started
