This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  25 MHz
   - PLL1   =  72 MHz
   - PLL2   =  40 MHz
   - PLL3   =  50 MHz
   - SYSCLK =  72 MHz
   - USBCLK =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - USART2: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

MCBSTM32C: Standalone application for Keil MCBSTM32C Board using
           COM port as a communication interface.

IMPORTAINT !!! Voltage on Vin pins should be in range from 5.25 to 5.5 V.
           Do not exceed 5.5V !!!

Notes:   - Cable necessary for connecting USB memory device should have 
           USB micro-A plug connector on one side and Standard USB Type-A
