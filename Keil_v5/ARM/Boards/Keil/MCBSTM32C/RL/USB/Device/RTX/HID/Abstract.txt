The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTM32C Board 
using a ST STM32F107VCT6 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs (LED0..7)
  - joystick

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and joystick can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  MCBSTM32C RTX:   configured for on-chip Flash ROM, RTX version
                  (used for production or target debugging)
