This program is a FTP Client example. It shows you how to manipulate 
files or directories on remote FTP server. This example will configure 
the LAN network parameters for the evaluation board automatically
if a DHCP Server is available in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

WARNING!!!

You need to modify FTPC_uif.c user interface module and enter:
 - username and pasword for logon
 - working directory on FTP server 
 - filename for a file command
 - new filename for a rename command
 - directory name for make or remove directory command
 - local filename
 
Modify also the FTP_client.c and enter:
 - FTP server IP address and port
 - FTP command to execute
