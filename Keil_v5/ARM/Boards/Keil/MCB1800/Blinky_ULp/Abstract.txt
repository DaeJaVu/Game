The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the LPC1850
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1800' Evaluation Board, compliant
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

It demonstrates the use of ULINKpro Debugger.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           12.00 MHz
   - CPU     =          120.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LED blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto ITM debug port #0

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SWO Trace:                  runs from NOR Flash located on board
                              shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
                              use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM" or "Cortex Debug" or "JTAG"

  TracePort Trace:            runs from NOR Flash located on board
                              shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
                              use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"

  TracePort InstructionTrace: runs from NOR Flash located on board
                              shows use of Instruction Trace
                              use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"

  Embedded Trace Buffer     : runs from NOR Flash located on board
                              shows use of Instruction Trace from the ETB
							  use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM" or "Cortex Debug" or "JTAG"


ULINKpro notes
--------------
LPC18xx_TP.ini enables synchronous 4bit Trace Interface
ETM Trace pins:  TRACECK         PF_4
                 TRACED0..3      PF_5..PF_8  (4 bit trace data)
                 do not use these pins in your application!

LPC18xx_TP.ini is not required for using the Embedded Trace Buffer.

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).
