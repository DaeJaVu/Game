The 'Demo' project is a demo program for the LPC1850 microcontroller
using Keil 'MCB1800' Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex
Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL =           12.00 MHz
   - CPU  =          180.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - Graphical LCD display shows two possible example modes

   Display shows:
    a) - 10-bit AD converter value bargraph depending on potentiometer position
       - State of buttons
       - Joystick directions
       - Touchscreen dependent images

    b) - LM 75 Thermometer output is stored into the 24LC128 EEPROM
       - Temperature samples from EEPROM are displayed on graph

Press or hold the WAKEUP0 key to change between example modes.


The Demo program is available for multiple targets:

  LPC1857 Flash:            runs from Internal flash located on chip
                            (may be used for target debugging)

  LPC1850 RAM:              runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                            (may be used for target debugging)

  LPC1850 Ext.Flash:        runs from NOR Flash located on board
                            (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC1850 Ext.Flash Lite:   same as 'LPC1850 Ext.Flash' but the bitmap-button
                            is exchanged with a text-button to meet the code
                            size limit of MDK-Lite (32K)
