This program is a BSD Client example. It is used to send commands
to a BSD_server or LEDSwitch server connected on the same LAN. The 
sending commands control LED diodes on remote Server, how they are
switched on or off.

In order to run this example, you need to set the network parameters
to match your local area network.

To test this example, run BSD_server or LEDSwitch server on eval board
and Client application on another eval board connected on the same LAN. 
The Client sends the value of P2 to BSD_server over TCP or UDP.

NOTE: IP address and MAC address of this example must be set different
      from IP and MAC addressess on LEDSwitch Server.

The BSD_client example is configured for Keil MCB1800 Board and is
available for several targets:

LPC1857 Flash:
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.

LPC1857 Flash Debug:
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.
    
    Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port to view
    output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
    8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

LPC1850 Ext. Flash:
    Program code is loaded into external NOR flash.

Jumper settings:
  J13 and J16 must connect pins 2 and 3
  to select and enable serial output on UART0/3 connector.
