The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCB1800 Board 

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  LPC1857_USB0 Flash:          configured for internal Flash
                              (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC1850_USB0 Ext. Flash:     configured for external Flash ROM
                               because of performance reasons, USB routines
                               are running from RAM,
                              (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC1857_USB1 Flash:          configured for internal Flash
                              (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC1850_USB1 Ext. Flash:     configured for external Flash ROM
