This is an RL-USB-Host Human Interface Device (HID) usage example.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0                  = 480 MHz
   - PLL1                  = 180 MHz
   - CPU  clock = PLL1     = 180 MHz
   - USB0 clock = PLL0     = 480 MHz
   - USB1 clock = PLL1 / 3 =  60 MHz

This example shows how to use USB Keyboard connected on USB1 
connector as terminal input to the device and it uses Graphic 
LCD as terminal output.

The Measure example is described in detail in the Getting Started
User's Guide.

The HID_KBD program is an application adapted for 
'MCB1800 Evaluation Board' with 'NXP LPC18xx microcontroller', 
it is availabe for 3 targets:

  LPC1857 Flash:       downloads to and executes from internal Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
  
  LPC1850 Ext. Flash:  downloads to and executes from external NOR Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC1850 RAM:         downloads to and executes from internal RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
