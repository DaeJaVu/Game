This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0                  = 480 MHz
   - PLL1                  = 180 MHz
   - CPU  clock = PLL1     = 180 MHz
   - USB0 clock = PLL0     = 480 MHz
   - USB1 clock = PLL1 / 3 =  60 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART3: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is an application adapted for 
'MCB1800 Evaluation Board' with 'NXP LPC18xx microcontroller', 
it is availabe for 3 targets:

  LPC1857 Flash:       downloads to and executes from internal Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
  
  LPC1850 Ext. Flash:  downloads to and executes from external NOR Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC1850 RAM:         downloads to and executes from internal RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
