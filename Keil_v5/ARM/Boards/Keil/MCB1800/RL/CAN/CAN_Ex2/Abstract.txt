This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Keil MCB1800 Evaluation Board'

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
 - PLL0                  = 480 MHz
 - PLL1                  = 180 MHz
 - CPU  clock = PLL1     = 180 MHz

Example functionality:
 - set converted analog value every 1 second to a message that 
   will be automatically returned upon reception of remote 
   transmission request and display it's value and count
 - transmit remote transmission request and display received 
   answer value and count
   CAN1 controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the values on LCD display change accordingly.


The CAN_Ex2 example program is available for several targets:
