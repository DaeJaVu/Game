The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCB11U10 Board 
using a NXP LPC11Uxx Microcontroller.

Example functionality: 
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   = 12 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK = 48 MHz
   - USB clock              = 48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs (LED0..7)
  - 2 Push Buttons

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  MCB11U10 RTX:   configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                 (used for production or target debugging)
