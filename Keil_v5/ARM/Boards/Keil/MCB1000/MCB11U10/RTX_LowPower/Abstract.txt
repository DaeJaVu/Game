The RTX_LowPower project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the NXP 'LPC11U14' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1000' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  48 MHz
   - USBPLL =  48 MHz

Example shows how to configure RTX for Low Power applications.

Application blinks the LED every 3s and goes into low power mode in between.
Pressing the ISP push button also wakes-up the device.

Power down is handled in the idle task (os_idle_demon in RTX_Conf.CM).


The LowPower program is available for target:

  LPC11U14 Flash: configured for on-chip Flash
                  (used for production or target debugging)


Note:
After the application is programmed into the device and running the debug system
is unavailable (due to application going into power down mode). It is necessary
to put the device into Bootloader mode in order to access it again via debugger.
This can be achieved by holding down the ISP push-button and pressing and 
releasing the Reset push-button. After that the device is in Bootloader mode
and can be re-programmed again.
