The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the NXP 'LPC1114' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1000' 
evaluation board and is compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  48 MHz


The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:      configured for software Simulator

  LPC1114 RAM:    runs from Internal Flash
                  (used for target debugging)

  LPC1114 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash
                  (used for production or target debugging)
