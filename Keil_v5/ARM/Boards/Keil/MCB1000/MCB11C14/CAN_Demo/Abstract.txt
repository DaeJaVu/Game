The CAN project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC11C14' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1000' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0)
and demonstrates the use of the CAN peripheral.

Example functionality: 
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  48 MHz

 - CAN controller speed: 500 kbits
 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message
 - display received byte on LEDs
 - output transmitted and received bytes on serial port
 - UART settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

This example shows how to use CAN peripheral and how to 
simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer


The CAN example is available in different targets:

  LPC11C14 RAM:   runs from Internal Flash
                  (used for target debugging)

  LPC11C14 Flash: runs from Internal Flash
                  (used for production or target debugging)



Notes:      
  - to use this example on real CAN network remove 
    CAN_testmode line from CanDemo.c file
