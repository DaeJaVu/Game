The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC11C14' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1000' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality: 
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  48 MHz


 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port 
 - UART settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:      configured for software Simulator

  LPC11C14 RAM:   runs from Internal Flash
                  (used for target debugging)

  LPC11C14 Flash: runs from Internal Flash
                  (used for production or target debugging)
