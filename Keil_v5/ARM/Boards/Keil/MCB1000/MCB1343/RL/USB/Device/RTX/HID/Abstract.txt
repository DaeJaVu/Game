The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCB1000 Board 
using a NXP LPC134x Microcontroller.

Example functionality: 
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  72 MHz
   - USBPLL =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs (PIO2.0..7)
  - 2 Push Buttons (S3, S4)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  MCB1000 RTX: configured for on-chip Flash ROM - RTX version
              (used for production or target debugging)
