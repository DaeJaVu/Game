The Memory project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC1343' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1000' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  72 MHz
   - USBPLL =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - LED0: LED_RD   lit when USB Device is performing Read access
  - LED1: LED_WR   lit when USB Device is performing Write access
  - LED2: LED_CFG  lit when USB Device is configured
  - LED3: LED_SUSP lit when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.


The Memory program is available for the following targets:

  LPC1343 Flash:   configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
