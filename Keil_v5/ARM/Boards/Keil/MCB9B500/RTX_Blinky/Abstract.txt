The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
Fujitsu 'MB9BF506R' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB9B500' 
Development Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:  
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =   4 MHz
   - CCLK  =  80 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  MB9BF506R Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  MB9BF506R RAM:    configured for on-chip RAM
                    (used for target debugging)
