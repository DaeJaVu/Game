The Blinky_ULp project is a simple demo program for the Fujitsu 'MB9BF506R' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB9B500' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.00).

It demonstrates the use of ULINKpro Debugger.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =   4 MHz
   - CCLK  =  80 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in IRQ mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto ITM debug port #0



The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  RAM:                       runs from Internal RAM located on chip

  SWO Trace:                 runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
                             use connector "Cortex Debug" or "Cortex Debug + ETM"
                             In debug session open window "watch 1", "Debug (printf) Viewer", "Logic Analyzer"

  TracePort Trace:           runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
                             use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"
                             In debug session open window "watch 1", "Debug (printf) Viewer", "Logic Analyzer"

  TracePort IntructionTrace: runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of Instruction Trace
                             use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"
                             In debug session open window "Instruction Trace"


ULINKpro notes
--------------
MB9BF50x_TP.ini enables TPIU interface

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).
