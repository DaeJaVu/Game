The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the Fujitsu 'MB9BF506R' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB9B500' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.00).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =   4 MHz
   - CCLK  =  80 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in IRQ mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto ITM debug port #0 (Target: MB9BF506R SWO)



The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  MB9BF506R Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  MB9BF506R RAM:    configured for on-chip RAM
                    (used for target debugging)

  MB9BF506R SWO:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip and is configured for SWO 
                    (USART ouput is redirected to SWO, open window "Debug (printf) Viewer")
