The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the TSX-1001
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBTSX1001' Evaluation Board, compliant
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           44.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           22.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - colour LCD display shows init message and bargraph depending on potentiometer position
 - AD settings: 16 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port UART
   UART settings: 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  TSX1001 Flash:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  TSX1001 RAM:      runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)
