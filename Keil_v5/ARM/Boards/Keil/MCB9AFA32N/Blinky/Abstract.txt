The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Fujitsu 'MB9AFA32N' microcontroller using Keil'MCB9AFA32N' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =   4 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  20 MHz

 - 4 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if any Button (SW0..SW3) is pressed all LEDs are lit.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  MB9AFA32N RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (used for target debugging)

  MB9AFA32N Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
