The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
Fujitsu 'MB9AFA32N' microcontroller using Keil'MCB9AFA32N' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =   4 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  20 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  MB9AFA32N RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (used for target debugging)

  MB9AFA32N Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
