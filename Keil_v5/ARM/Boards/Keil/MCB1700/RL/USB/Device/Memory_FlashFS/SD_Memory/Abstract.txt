The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCB1700 Board 
using a NXP LPC17xx Microcontroller.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL            =  12 MHz
   - PLL0            = 400 MHz
   - CCLK   = PLL0/4 = 100 MHz
   - PLL1            =  48 MHz
   - USBCLK = PLL1   =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  MCB1700:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
              (used for production or target debugging)
