The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCB1700 Board 
using a NXP LPC17xx Microcontroller.

Example functionality: 
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                   =  12 MHz
   - PLL                    = 400 MHz
   - processor clock = CCLK = 100 MHz
   - USB clock              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK / 4 clock         =  25 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  MCB1700 RTX: configured for on-chip Flash ROM - RTX version
              (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper D-, D+ to DEVICE
