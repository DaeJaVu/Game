This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device and do the same on the SD Card. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - PLL0   = 400 MHz
   - PLL1   =  48 MHz
   - CCLK   = 100 MHz
   - USBCLK =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART1: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_SD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

MCB1700:   Standalone application for Keil MCB1700 Board using
           COM port as a communication interface.

Note: Jumpers position:
         - "D-"    -> HOST position (3-4 shorted)
         - "D+"    -> HOST position (3-4 shorted)
