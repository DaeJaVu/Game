The CAN project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC1768' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 400 MHz
   - CCLK  = 100 MHz
   - PCLK  =  25 MHz (CCLK / 4)

 - CAN controller speed: 500 kbits
 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message
   from CAN controller #2 to CAN Controller #1 
 - display received and transmitted byte values on GLCD display
 - display received byte on LEDs

This example shows how to use CAN peripheral and how to 
simulate analog input in uVision.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer


The CAN example is available in different targets:

  Simulator:     configured for software Simulator

  LPC1768 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  LPC1768 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)


Note: Loopback between CAN1 and CAN2 is necessary for this demo
