The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple demo program for the Toshiba 'TMPM369FDFG' microcontroller
using the Keil MCBTMPM369 evaluation board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  16 MHz
   - PLL        =  80 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  80 MHz

 - 1 LED blinks with a fixed speed.
   (two RTX tasks are used to blink the LED)


The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  TMPM369 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
  TMPM369 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)
