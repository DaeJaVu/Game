The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the NXP 'LPC4350' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB4300'
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL =  12 MHz
   - CPU  = 180 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

  LPC4350 Ext. Flash:  runs from NOR Flash located on board
                       (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC4350 RAM:         runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                       (may be used for target debugging)


Following Targets are for Flash-based parts only!
(Valid Flash Signature is created with ElfDwT tool. See "Options for Target" - "User")

  LPC4357 Flash:       configured for on-chip Flash BankA
                       (Booting from BANK A)
