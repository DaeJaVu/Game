The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the LPC4350
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB4300' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL =           12.00 MHz
   - CPU  =          180.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LEDs are blinking with speed depending on SysTick timer interrupt period


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC4350 RAM:         runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                       (may be used for target debugging)

  LPC4350 Ext. Flash:  runs from NOR Flash located on board
                       (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC4350 SPIFI:       runs from SPIFI Flash located on board
                       (used for production or target debugging)
                       set jumper for boot pins to boot from SPIFI!


Following Targets are for Flash-based parts only!
