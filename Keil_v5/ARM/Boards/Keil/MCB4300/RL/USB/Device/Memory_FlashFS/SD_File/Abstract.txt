The SD_File project is a demo program for the Keil MCB4300 Board

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

File manipulation from the target is also available over serial port.

When Wakeup button is pressed the USB Memory is unmounted from the PC
and can be accessed from the target over serial port. It allows to 
create, read, copy, delete files and format the card.
Pressing Wakeup button again, will re-mount the USB Memory on the PC.

Connect a serial cable to RS232 UART1/3/4 port using HyperTerminal
  at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, No Flow Control.

The Memory program is available for the following targets:
  LPC4357_USB0 Flash:        configured for internal Flash
                            (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4350_USB0 Ext. Flash:   configured for external Flash
                             because of performance reasons, USB routines
                             are running from RAM,
                            (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4357_USB1 Flash:        configured for internal Flash
                            (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4350_USB1 Ext. Flash:   configured for external Flash
                            (used for production or target debugging)
