The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCB4300 Board

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs
  - 4 BUTTONs (P4_0, P4_3, P4_4, WAKEUP)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  LPC4357_USB0 Flash:        configured for internal Flash
                            (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4350_USB0 Ext. Flash:   configured for external Flash
                             because of performance reasons, USB routines
                             are running from RAM,
                            (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4357_USB1 Flash:        configured for internal Flash
                            (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4350_USB1 Ext. Flash:   configured for external Flash
                            (used for production or target debugging)
