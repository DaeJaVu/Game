The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCB4300 Board 

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  LPC4357_USB0 Flash:        configured for internal Flash
                            (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4350_USB0 Ext. Flash:   configured for external Flash
                             because of performance reasons, USB routines
                             are running from RAM,
                            (used for production or target debugging)
  LPC4357_USB1 Flash:        configured for internal Flash
                            (used for production or target debugging)
