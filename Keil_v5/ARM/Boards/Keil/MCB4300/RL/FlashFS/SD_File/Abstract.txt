This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card. 

Example properties:

  - Clock settings:
    - XTAL        =  12 MHz
    - CPU Clock   = 180 MHz

  - Serial settings:
    - Connect a serial cable to UART0/3 COM port
    - 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity


The SD_FILE program is a standalone application for Keil MCB4300 Board
available for multiple targets:

LPC4357 Flash:
    Program code is loaded into internal flash and serial debug port is
    used as a communication interface.

LPC4350 Ext. Flash:
    Program code is loaded into external NOR flash and serial debug port is
    used as a communication interface.

LPC4350 RAM:
    Program code is loaded into internal RAM and serial debug port is
    used as a communication interface.

    Start debug session (Ctrl + F5) and start code execution - press
    Run (F5).


Jumper settings:
  J13 and J16 must: - Connect pins 2 and 3 to select and enable serial
                      output on UART0/3 connector.
