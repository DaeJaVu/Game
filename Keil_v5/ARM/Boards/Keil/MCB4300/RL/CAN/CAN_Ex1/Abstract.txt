This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Keil MCB4300 Evaluation Board' with 
'NXP LPC4350' microcontroller.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
 - PLL0                  = 480 MHz
 - PLL1                  = 180 MHz
 - CPU  clock = PLL1     = 180 MHz

Example functionality:
 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN1 controller every 1 second
 - display received and transmitted byte values and count on 
   LCD display
   CAN1 controller speed: 500 kbits

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer 
and watch the values on LCD display change accordingly.


The CAN_Ex1 example program is available for several targets:

  LPC4357 Flash:         downloads to and executes from internal Flash
                        (used for target debugging)
  LPC4350 Ext. Flash :   downloads to and executes from external Flash
                        (used for target debugging)
  LPC4350 RAM:           downloads to and executes from internal RAM
                        (used for target debugging)
