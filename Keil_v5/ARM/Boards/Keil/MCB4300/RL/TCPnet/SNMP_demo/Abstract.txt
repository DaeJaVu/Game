This program is an SNMP Agent demo example. It shows how to 
use a Simple Network Management Protocol to control the
embedded system.

Use this example to connect MCB4300 Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect MCB4300 Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

To test this example, run windows application 'SNMPTest.exe' and
type in the ip address of your Embedded SNMP Agent and click
'Connect'. When connected, you can change the LCD text on
the target, control the onboard LED diodes and monitor the
state of onboard pushbuttons.

The SNMP_demo example is configured for Keil MCB4300 Board and is
available for several targets:

LPC4357 Flash:
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.

LPC4357 Flash Debug:
    Standalone Debug application.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.
    
    Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port to view
    output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
    8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

LPC4350 Ext. Flash:
    Program code is loaded into external NOR flash.


Jumper settings:
  J13 and J16 must connect pins 2 and 3
  to select and enable serial output on UART0/3 connector.
