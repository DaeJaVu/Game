This program shows you how to resolve an IP address of a Host
from the Host name. It sends a DNS request to a remote DNS server. 

This example will configure the LAN network parameters for 
the evaluation board automatically if a DHCP Server is available
in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

The DNS_demo example is configured for Keil MCB4300 Board and is
available for several targets:

LPC4357 Flash:
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.
    System messages printed to COM serial port.

LPC4357 Flash Debug:
    Standalone Debug application.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.
    
    Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port to view
    output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
    8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

LPC4350 Ext. Flash:
    Program code is loaded into external NOR flash.
    System messages printed to COM serial port.

Jumper settings:
  J13 and J16 must connect pins 2 and 3
  to select and enable serial output on UART0/3 connector.
