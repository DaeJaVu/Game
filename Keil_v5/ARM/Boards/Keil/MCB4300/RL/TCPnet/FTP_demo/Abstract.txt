This is a FTP Server example. It allows you to manage files
on SD Card from PC using FTP client.

Use this example to connect MCB4300 Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect MCB4300 Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.101

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your ftp client and enter the
address ftp://mcb4300/ or ftp://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>
