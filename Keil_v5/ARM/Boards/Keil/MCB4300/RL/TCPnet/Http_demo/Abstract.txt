This is a HTTP Server example. It shows you how to use the
Web Server CGI interface as well. 

Use this example to connect MCB4300 Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect MCB4300 Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.101

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

The WEB pages are included into the project under HTTP Files 
group. You can simply add or remove a page or image. Web files
which are compiled into the project are added to the 'Web.inp'
Web Converter input file.

To test this example, open your web browser and enter the 
address http://mcb4300/ or http://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

You can change the password at runtime on page 'system'

The HTTP_demo example is configured for Keil MCB4300 Board and is
available for several targets:

LPC4357 Flash:
    Standalone (no RTX Kernel) application.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.

LPC4357 Flash Debug:
    Standalone (no RTX Kernel) with debug output.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.

    Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c configuration file.
    Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port using
    HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
    1 stop bit, flowcontrol none.

LPC4357 Flash RTX:
    The same example configured for RTX Kernel.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.

LPC4350 Ext. Flash:
    Standalone (no RTX Kernel) application.
    Program code is loaded into external NOR flash.

Jumper settings:
  J13 and J16 must connect pins 2 and 3
  to select and enable serial output on UART0/3 connector.
