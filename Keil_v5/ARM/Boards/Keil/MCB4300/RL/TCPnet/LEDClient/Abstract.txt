This program is a LEDSwitch Client example. It is used to send commands
to a LEDSwitch Server connected on the same LAN. The sending commands 
control LED diodes on remote Server, how they are switched on or off.

In order to run this example, you need to set the network parameters
to match your local area network.

To test this example, run application LEDSwitch on one MCB4300
board and Client application on another MCB4300 board.
The Client application sends the value of P2 to LEDSwitch 
application over TCP or UDP.

NOTE: IP address and MAC address of this example must be set different
      from IP and MAC addressess on LEDSwitch Server.

The Client example is configured for Keil MCB4300 Board and is
available for several targets:

LPC4357 Flash:
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.

LPC4357 Flash Debug:
    Standalone Debug application.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.

    Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port to view
    output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
    8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

LPC4350 Ext. Flash:
    Program code is loaded into external NOR flash.


Jumper settings:
  J13 and J16 must connect pins 2 and 3
  to select and enable serial output on UART0/3 connector.
