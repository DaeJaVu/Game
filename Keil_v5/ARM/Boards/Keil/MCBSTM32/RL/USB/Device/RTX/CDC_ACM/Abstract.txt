The Virtual COM Port project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTM32 Board 
using a ST STM32F103RB Microcontroller.
It demonstrates a bridge between USB USB Virtual COM port and UART port on the 
evaluation board and is based on a Windows USB host driver (usbser.sys).

This example does not use RTS/CTS lines on UART for flow control.

The PC will install a Virtual COM Port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
After installation an additional port "MCBSTM32 USB VCom Port(COMx)"
can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different 
"x" displayed on the device manager. The USB host driver assigns "x" 
dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration of the system.
   
Testing the USB Virtual COM Port with serial cable:

  Open two Hyperterminal windows. 
      One with "MCBSTM32 USB VCom Port(COMx)" 
      One with "Communications Port (COM1)" 
  Connect PC port COM1 to MCBSTM32 COM and open "COM1" and "COMx".
  Data from "COM1" will be echoed on "COMx" and visa versa. 
  So, this is bi-directional communication between the physical COM 
  port on MCBSTM32 and the Virtual COM Port COMx on host PC.

The Virtual COM Port program is available for the following target:
  MCBSTM32 RTX:    configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                  (used for production or target debugging)
