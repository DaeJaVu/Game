The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTM32 Board 
using a ST STM32F103RBT6 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  MCBSTM32:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
               (used for production or target debugging)

Note: Set jumper J1 to PD2 for debugging
