The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTM32 Board 
using a ST STM32F103RBT6 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs (LED0..7)
  - 2 Push Buttons (TAMP, WKUP)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.


The HID program is available for the following target:
  MCBSTM32:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
               (used for production or target debugging)

Note: set jumper J1 to PD2 for debugging
