The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTM32 Board 
using a ST STM32F103RBT6 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

File manipulation from the target is also available over COM Port.

When WKUP (S2) button is pressed the USB Memory is unmounted from the PC
and can be accessed from the target over COM Port. It allows to create,
read, copy, delete files and format the card. Pressing WKUP (S2) button
again will re-mount the USB Memory on the PC.

Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port using HyperTerminal
  at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, No Flow Control.

The Memory program is available for the following target:
  MCBSTM32:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
               (used for production or target debugging)

Note: Set jumper J1 to PD2 for debugging
