The Measure project is a simple datalogger for the ST 'STM32F103RB' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - AD conversion is done in DMA mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The Measure program uses analog and digital inputs to simulate a datalogger.
You may watch the value of analog input POT1 and the state of S2, S3 Buttons
on MCBSTM32 Evaluation Board.



The program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator
                      Serial Window #1
                      ADC1 channel 1 simulated using a debug function.

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F103 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
