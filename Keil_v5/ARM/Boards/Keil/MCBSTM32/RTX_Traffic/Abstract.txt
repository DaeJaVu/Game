The RTX_Traffic project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for the
ST 'STM32F103RB' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

Traffic is a program that controls a traffic light.

The traffic light is timed and lets cars pass during a
specific time period.  There is a pedestrial crossing button (S3)
that lets pedestrians cross.  

There are several things of interest here:

*  This program uses RTX Kernel. Program initialization
   and operation code are in Traffic. Look for the
   init task to see where everything starts.

*  USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Traffic program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:       configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash: configured for on-chip Flash
                   (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F103 RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM
                   (used for target debugging)
