The PWM_1 project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - TIM4 is running at  1Hz.
   Channel 3 has a duty cicle of 50% and lits LED PB8
   Channel 4 has a duty cicle of 25% and lits LED PB9


The PWM_1 program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
