The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the ST 'STM32F103RB' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz


The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                      (used for production or target debugging)
