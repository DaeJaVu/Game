The Tamper project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - After startup BKP_DR1 and BKP_DR2 are set to specific values.
   Tamper pin is configured to generate an interrupt  
   led PB9 is lit if BKP_DR1, BKP_DR2 are cleared upon a tamper event
   led PB8 is lit if BKP_DR1, BKP_DR2 are not cleared 


The Tamper program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
