The GPIO project is a simple demo program for the ST 'STM32F103RB' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

 - Pressing buttons S2, S3 move the lit LED.
   press S2 to move the lit LED to the right
   press S3 to move the lit LED to the left


The GPIO program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:          configured for software Simulator

  STM32F103 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
