The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
NXP 'LPC1549' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1500' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - CCLK  =  72 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 4 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1 
 - USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC1549 Flash: Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP
                 runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC1549 RAM:   Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP
                 runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  LPC1549 SWO:   Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK2
                 runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 shows use of ITM output, Exception Trace
