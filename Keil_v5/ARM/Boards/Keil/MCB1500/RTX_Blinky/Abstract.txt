The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
NXP 'LPC1549' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1500' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  12 MHz
   - SYSPLL =  72 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:


- phase A
- phase B
- phase C

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC1549 Flash: Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP
                 runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC1549 RAM:   Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP
                 runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)
