This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Keil MCBTMPM360 Evaluation Board' with 
'Toshiba TMPM364' microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  12 MHz
   - PLL        =  48 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  48 MHz
 - CAN 1 controller speed: 500 kbits

 - set converted analog value in first byte in CAN message 
   that will automatically be sent upon reception of REMOTE
   TRANSMISSION REQUEST message on CAN 1 controller
 - send REMOTE TRANSMISSION REQUEST message on CAN 1
   controller, every 1 second
 - display higher 4 bits of received response to REMOTE 
   TRANSMISSION REQUEST message on CAN 1 controller in 
   hexadecimal representation on 4 LEDs

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver.

You may change the value of analog input with potentiometer (AIN0) 
and watch the value on 4 LEDs change accordingly.

The 'CAN_Ex2' example program is available for target:

  TMPM364 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
  TMPM364 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

Notes:      
  - To see the example functionality with using only one board 
    press PJ4 button on power-on to initialize CAN controller 
    in loopback mode (it receives whatever it sends)
