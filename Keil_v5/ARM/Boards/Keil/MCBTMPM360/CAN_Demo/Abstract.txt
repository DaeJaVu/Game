This example program shows how to use the CAN on 
'Keil MCBTMPM360 Evaluation Board' with 
'Toshiba TMPM364' microcontroller.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  12 MHz
   - PLL        =  48 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  48 MHz
 - CAN 1 controller speed: 500 kbits

 - send converted analog value in first byte in CAN message on 
   CAN 1 controller every 100 millisecond
 - display higher 4 bits of received byte on CAN 1 controller in 
   hexadecimal representation on 4 LEDs

This example can be tested by using two 'MCBTMPM360' with CAN 
connected between themselves.
In that configuration turning potentiometer on one board will 
change state on LEDs on the other board and vice versa.

This example can also be tested if only one 'MCBTMPM360' board 
is availabe. By pressing PJ4 button during power-on example 
initializes CAN controller in loopback mode so that whatever 
CAN controller sends it also receives.
In that configuration turning potentiometer will change state 
of LEDs.

The 'CAN_Demo' example program is available for target:

  TMPM364 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
  TMPM364 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)
