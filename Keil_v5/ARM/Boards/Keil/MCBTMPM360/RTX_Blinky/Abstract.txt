The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the Toshiba 'TMPM36x' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBTMPM360' 
evaluation board and is compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  12 MHz
   - PLL        =  48 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  48 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  TMPM36x Flash:   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging with uLink/uLink2)
  TMPM36x RAM:     runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (used for target debugging)
