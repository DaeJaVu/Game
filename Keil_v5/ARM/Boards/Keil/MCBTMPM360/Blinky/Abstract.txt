The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for the Toshiba 'TMPM36x' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBTMPM360' evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  12 MHz
   - PLL        =  48 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  48 MHz
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 4 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - when any of buttons PJ4..PJ7 is pressed appropriate LED is turned on

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  TMPM36x Flash:   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging with ULINK/ULINK2)
  TMPM36x RAM:     runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (used for target debugging)
