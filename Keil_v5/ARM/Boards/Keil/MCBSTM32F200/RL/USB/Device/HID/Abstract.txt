The HID project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTM32F200 
Board using a ST STM32F207  Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs
  - 3 BUTTONs (Wakeup, Tamper, Key)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  MCBSTM32F200 HS:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
  MCBSTM32F200 FS:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                   (used for production or target debugging)
