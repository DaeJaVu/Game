The Memory project is a demo program for the Keil MCBSTM32F200 
Board using STM32F207IG Microcontroller.

Example functionality:

  - Clock settings:
    - XTAL          =  25 MHz
    - PLL VCO Clock = 240 MHz
    - CPU Clock     = 120 MHz
    - USB Clock     =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
NAND Flash memory on the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

STM32F207 Flash:  Configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                  (used for production or target debugging)
