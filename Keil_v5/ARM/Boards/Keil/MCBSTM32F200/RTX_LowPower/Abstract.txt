The RTX_LowPower project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
ST 'STM32F207' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32F200' Evaluation Board,
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  25 MHz
   - SYSCLK = 120 MHz
   - HCLK   = 120 MHz

Example shows how to configure RTX for Low Power applications.

Application blinks the LED every 3s and goes into low power mode in between.
Pressing the ISP push button also wakes-up the device.

Power down is handled in the idle task (os_idle_demon in RTX_Conf.CM).


The LowPower program is available for target:

  STM32F207 Flash: configured for on-chip Flash
                   (used for production or target debugging)
