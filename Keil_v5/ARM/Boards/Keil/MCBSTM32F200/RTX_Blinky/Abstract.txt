The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
ST 'STM32F207' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32F200' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  25 MHz
   - SYSCLK  = 120 MHz
   - HCLK    = 120 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

  STM32F207 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F207 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)
