The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for
ST 'STM32F407IG' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32F400' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =          168.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LEDs are blinking with speed depending on SysTick timer interrupt period
 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F407 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)

  STM32F407 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F407 OPT:    STM32F407 with Flash Options Bytes
                    (used for programming)

  STM32F407 OTP:    STM32F407 with Flash One-Time Programmable Bytes
                    (used for programming)
