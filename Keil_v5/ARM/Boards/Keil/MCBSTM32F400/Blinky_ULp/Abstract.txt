The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
ST 'STM32F407IG' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32F400' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

It demonstrates the use of ULINKpro Debugger.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =           25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =          168.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LED blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto ITM debug port #0  

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SWO Trace:                 runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
                             use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM" or "Cortex Debug" or "JTAG"

  TracePort Trace:           runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace
                             use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"

  TracePort IntructionTrace: runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of Instruction Trace
                              use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"


ULINKpro notes
--------------
STM32F4xx_TP.ini enables synchronous 4bit Trace Interface
ETM Trace pins:  TRACECK         PE2
                 TRACED0..3      PE3..PE6    (4 bit trace data)
                 do not use these pins in your application!

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).

STM32_SWO.ini enables asynchronous Trace Interface

Jumper Configuration:
  Set jumpers J10, J11, J12 (close to ETM connector) to position 'Trace'.
