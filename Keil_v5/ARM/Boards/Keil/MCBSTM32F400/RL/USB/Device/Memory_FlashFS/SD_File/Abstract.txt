The Memory project is a demo program for the MCBSTM32F400
Board using STM32F407IG Microcontroller.

Example functionality:

  - Clock settings:
    - XTAL          =  25 MHz
    - PLL VCO Clock = 336 MHz
    - CPU Clock     = 168 MHz
    - USB Clock     =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

File manipulation from the target is also available over serial port.

When Wakeup button is pressed the USB Memory is unmounted from the PC
and can be accessed from the target over serial port. It allows to 
create, read, copy, delete files and format the card.
Pressing Wakeup button again, will re-mount the USB Memory on the PC.

Connect a serial cable to RS232 UART1/3/4 port using HyperTerminal
  at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, No Flow Control.


The Memory program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

STM32F407 Flash:
    Standalone application for MCBSTM32F400 Board using serial port
    as communication interface.
    

Jumper settings:
    J13 and J14 must connect pins 2 and 3 to enable serial output on
    UART1.
