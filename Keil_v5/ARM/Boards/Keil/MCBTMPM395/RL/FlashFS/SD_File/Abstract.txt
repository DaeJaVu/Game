This is a RL-ARM Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card. 

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  20 MHz
   - CCLK  =  20 MHz

   - SIO0: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
     

The SD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

MCBTMPM395:  Standalone application for Keil 'MCBTMPM395' evaluation board
             using USB port as a communication interface.

             Connect a USB cable to USB port. 
             (SILICON LABS CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Driver needs to be installed).
             Use HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.
