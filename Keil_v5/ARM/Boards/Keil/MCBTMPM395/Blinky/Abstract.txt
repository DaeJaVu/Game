The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for the Toshiba 'TMPM395FWXBG' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBTMPM395' evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  20 MHz
   - CCLK  =  20 MHz
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 2 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - when any of buttons PB7, PB5 is pressed appropriate LED is turned on

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  MCBTMPM395 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                     (used for production or target debugging)

  MCBTMPM395 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                     (used for target debugging)

  MCBTMPM395 Trace:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                     (configured for instruction trace with ULINKpro
                      use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"            )
