The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the 
ARM 'Microcontroller Prototyping System' Cortex-M0, done according to 
Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.0).

It blinks CPU and DUT LEDs at a constant rate with using SysTick Timer.

It also demonstrates  simple execution trace capability of Cortex-M0
with Micro Trace Buffer (MTB). Executed instructions are shown in
Trace window.

Trace can be easy configured by editing the debug initialization file
using the Configuration Wizard.

Note: MPS needs to be programmed with Cortex-M0 MTB image.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  MPS CM0 Ext RAM:   runs from External RAM located on the board
                     (used for target debugging)
  MPS CM0 Ext Flash: runs from External NOR Flash located on the board
                     (used for production or target debugging)
