The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the Infineon 'XMC4500' 
microcontroller using Hitex 'XMC-HiLight' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - CCLK  = 120 MHz

 - 3 LED blinks with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  XMC4500 Flash:        runs from Internal Flash (uncached) located on chip
                        (used for production or target debugging)

  XMC4500 cached Flash: runs from Internal Flash (cached) located on chip
                        (used for production or target debugging)

  XMC4500 PSRAM:        runs from Internal PSRAM located on chip
                        (used for target debugging)
