This program shows you how to resolve an IP address of a Host
from the Host name. It sends a DNS request to a remote DNS server. 

This example will configure the LAN network parameters for 
the evaluation board automatically if a DHCP Server is available
in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

The DNS_demo example is available for several targets:

XMC4500:
    Standalone application for XMC-HiLight Board.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.
    System messages printed to ITM debug channel.

    Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
    in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    System messages printed to ITM debug channel.
