The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM3S4C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3S-EK' evaluation board.
This project is compliant to CMSIS v2.0.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 128 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  64 MHz
 - Red LED blinks with speed of 1 second, determined by SysTick Timer
   working in interrupt mode.
   Blue and Green LEDs alternate between them.


The Blinky program is available for target:

  SAM3S RAM:            configured for on-chip RAM
                        (used for debugging)

  SAM3S Flash:          configured for on-chip Flash
                        (used for production or target debugging)

  SAM3U Flash + GPNVM:  configured for on-chip Flash bank
                        configures GPNVM bits to boot from Flash Bank

 Use a clock of 64 MHz for Serial Wire Viewer.

Note:
  example is preconfigured for SAM3S-EK Rev.B
