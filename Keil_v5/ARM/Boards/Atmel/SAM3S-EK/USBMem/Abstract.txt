The 'Memory' project is a demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM3S4C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3S-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

LEDs are used to display the following:
  - D2: LED_CFG  is on when USB Device is configured
  - D3: LED_SUSP is on when USB Device is suspended

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.


The Memory program is available for the following targets:

  SAM3S Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                (used for production or target debugging)


Note:
  example is preconfigured for SAM3S-EK Rev.B
