The HID project is a demo program for the Atmel SAM3S-EK Board 
using a Atmel SAM3S4C Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 2 LEDs (D2..D3)
  - 2 Push Buttons (USRPB1, USRPB2)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  SAM3S-EK:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
               (used for production or target debugging)

Note:
  example is preconfigured for SAM3S-EK Rev.B
