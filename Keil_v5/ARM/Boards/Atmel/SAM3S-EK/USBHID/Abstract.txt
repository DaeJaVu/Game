The 'HID' project is a demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM3S4C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3S-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 2 LEDs (D2..D3)
  - 2 Push Buttons (USRPB1, USRPB2)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.


The HID program is available for the following targets:

  SAM3S Flash:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                (used for production or target debugging)


Note:
  example is preconfigured for SAM3S-EK Rev.B
