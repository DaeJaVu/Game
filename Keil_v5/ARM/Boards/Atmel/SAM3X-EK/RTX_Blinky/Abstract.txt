The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the Atmel 'SAM3X8H' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3X-EK' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. LEDs are blinking simulating the activity of the clock task.

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAM3X Flash:   configured for on-chip Flash
                 (used for production or target debugging)

  SAM3X RAM:     configured for on-chip RAM
                 (used for target debugging)
