The 'LCD_Blinky" project is a simple program for
Atmel 'ATSAM3X8H' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3X-EK' evaluation board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

 - Displays rotating ARM 3D logo, each picture is displayed every 150 ms
 - 3 LEDs blink with speed of 50 ms, determined by SysTick Timer
   working in interrupt mode
 

The Blinky program is available for target:

  SAM3X Flash:   configured for on-chip Flash
                 (used for production or target debugging)



Notes: - In EVAL version of uVision do not rebuild the target as 
         this example's size exceeds EVAL version limitation

Picture conversion procedure:
1. Convert picture to 16 BPP (R - 5bits, G - 6bits, B - 5bits)
2. Remove header from bmp by hex editor, remaining file size should 
   be equal to (width * height * 2) bytes
3. Convert prepared file without header to C array
