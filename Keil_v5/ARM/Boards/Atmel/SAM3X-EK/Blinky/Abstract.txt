The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM3X8H' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3X-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - colour GLCD display shows
   - init message
   - AD value and bargraph (depending on potentiometer position)
   - buttons status
 - AD conversion is done in DMA or IRQ mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1
   - USART0 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAM3X Flash:           configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)

  SAM3X Flash + GPNVM:   configured for on-chip Flash bank
                         configures GPNVM bits to boot from Flash 0

  SAM3X RAM:             configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)
