This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card. 

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

   - USART (USART0) port: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The SD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

  SAM3X Flash: Standalone application for Atmel SAM3X-EK Board using
               USART port as a communication interface.

               Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port using
               HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
               1 stop bit, flow control none.
