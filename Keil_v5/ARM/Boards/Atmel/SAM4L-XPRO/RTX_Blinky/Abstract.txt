The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
Atmel 'ATSAM4LC4C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM4L Xplained pro' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  12 MHz
   - CPU     =  40 MHz (RC80M / 2)


 - 1 LED blinks with a fixed speed.
   (two RTX tasks are used to blink the LED)

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAM4L RAM:             configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)

  SAM4L Flash:           configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)
