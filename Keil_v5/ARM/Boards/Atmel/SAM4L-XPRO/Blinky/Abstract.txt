The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM4LC4C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM4L Xplained pro' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  12 MHz
   - CPU     =  40 MHz (RC80M / 2)

 - 1 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if Button (SW0) is pressed all LEDs are lit.
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port UART1 (Virtual Com Port)
   UART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAM4L RAM:          configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)

  SAM4L Flash:        configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
