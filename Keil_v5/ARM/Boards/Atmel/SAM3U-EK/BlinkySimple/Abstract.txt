The 'BlinkySimple' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM3U4E' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3U-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - Main Clock            =   4 MHz


The BlinkySimple program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:             configured for software Simulator

  SAM3U RAM:             configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)
                         LEDs D2, D3 are blinking

  SAM3U Flash:           configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)
                         LEDs D2, D3 are blinking

  SAM3U Flash0 + GPNVM:  configured for on-chip Flash bank0
                         configures GPNVM bits to boot from Flash Bank0
                         only LED D2 is blinking

  SAM3U Flash1 + GPNVM:  configured for on-chip Flash bank1
                         configures GPNVM bits to boot from Flash Bank1
                         only LED D3 is blinking
