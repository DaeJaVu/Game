The Memory project is a demo program for the Atmel SAM3U-EK Board
using AT91SAM3U4E Microcontroller.

Example functionality:
  - Clock settings:
    - XTAL          =  12 MHz
    - PLLA          = 168 MHz
    - CPU Clock     =  84 MHz
    - USB Clock     =  48 MHz

  - USART port: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

File manipulation from the target is also available over serial port.

When USR-RIGHT button is pressed the USB Memory is unmounted from the PC
and can be accessed from the target over serial port. It allows to 
create, read, copy, delete files and format the card.
Pressing USR-RIGHT button again, will re-mount the USB Memory on the PC.

Connect a serial cable to RS232 UART1/3/4 port using HyperTerminal
  at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, No Flow Control.


The Memory program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

SAM3U4E Flash:
    Standalone application for SAM3U-EK Board using RTX kernel
    and serial port as communication interface.
