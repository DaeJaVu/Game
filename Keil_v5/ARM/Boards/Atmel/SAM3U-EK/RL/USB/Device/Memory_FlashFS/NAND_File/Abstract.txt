The Memory project is a demo program for the Atmel SAM3U-EK Board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

   - USART port: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
NAND Flash device is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

File manipulation from the target is also available over COM Port.

When USR-RIGHT button is pressed the USB Memory is unmounted from
the PC and can be accessed from the target over USART Port. It
allows to create, read, copy, delete files and format the NAND
Flash. Pressing USR-RIGHT button again will re-mount the USB Memory
on the PC.

The Memory program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

SAM3U-EK:  Standalone application for ATSAM3U-EK Board using
           USART port as a communication interface.

           Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port using
           HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
           1 stop bit, No Flow Control.
