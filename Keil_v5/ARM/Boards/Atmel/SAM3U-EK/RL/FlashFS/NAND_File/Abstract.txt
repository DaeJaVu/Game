This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files on the NAND Flash
Memory. 

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

   - USART port: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The NAND_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

  SAM3U Flash:  Standalone application for Atmel SAM3U-EK Board using
                DBGU port as a communication interface.

                Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM port using
                HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
                1 stop bit, flow control none.
