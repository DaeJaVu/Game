The 'Measure' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM3U4E' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3U-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

The program uses analog and digital inputs to simulate a datalogger.
You may watch the value of analog input ADC0, ADC1 and the state 
of USR_LEFT, USR_RIGHT Buttons on SAM3U-EK evaluation board.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

 - Output onto serial port USART1 
   USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 - AD is used with DMA or IRQ
   AD settings: 12 bit resolution


The Measure program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:     configured for software Simulator
                 USART1 is "Serial Window #3"

  SAM3U RAM:     configured for on-chip RAM
                 (used for debugging)

  SAM3U Flash:   configured for on-chip Flash
