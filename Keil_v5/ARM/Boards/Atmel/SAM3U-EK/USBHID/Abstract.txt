The 'HID' project is a demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM3U4E' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3U-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz
   - USB clock             =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 2 LEDs (D2..3)
  - 2 Push Buttons (USR_LEFT, USR_RIGHT)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.


The HID program is available for the following targets:

  SAM3U Flash:   configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                 (used for production or target debugging)
