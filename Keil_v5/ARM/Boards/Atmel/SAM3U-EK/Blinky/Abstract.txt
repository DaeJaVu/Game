The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM3U4E' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3U-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 2 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - colour GLCD display shows
   - init message
   - AD value and bargraph (depending on potentiometer position)
   - buttons status
 - AD conversion is done in DMA or IRQ mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1 
   - USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:     configured for software Simulator

  SAM3U RAM:     configured for on-chip RAM
                 (used for debugging)

  SAM3U Flash:   configured for on-chip Flash
                 (used for production or target debugging)
