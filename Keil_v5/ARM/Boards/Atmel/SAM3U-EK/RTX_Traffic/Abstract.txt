The 'RTX_Traffic' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
Atmel 'ATSAM3U4E' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM3U-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  = 168 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA / 2 =  84 MHz

Traffic is a program that controls a traffic light.

The traffic light is timed and lets cars pass during a
specific time period.  There is a pedestrial crossing button (USR-LEFT)
that lets pedestrians cross.  

There are several things of interest here:

*  This program uses RTX Kernel. Program initialization
   and operation code are in Traffic. Look for the
   init task to see where everything starts.

*  USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Traffic program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:     configured for software Simulator
                 USART1 is "Serial Window #3"

  SAM3U RAM:     configured for on-chip RAM
                 (used for target debugging)

  SAM3U Flash:   configured for on-chip Flash
                 (used for production or target debugging)
