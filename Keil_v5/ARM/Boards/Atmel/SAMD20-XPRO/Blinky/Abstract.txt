The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAMD20J18' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM0+D Xplained pro' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =    OSC8M
   - CPU Clock  =    1 MHz

 - 1 LED blinks with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if Button (sw0) is pressed all LEDs are lit.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAMD20 RAM:      runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (used for target debugging)

  SAMD20 Flash:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
