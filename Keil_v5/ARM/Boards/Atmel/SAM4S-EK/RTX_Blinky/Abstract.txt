The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
Atmel 'ATSAM4S16' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM4S-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  =  96 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA     =  96 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor
driver. LEDs are blinking simulating the activity of the clock task.

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAM4S Flash:   configured for on-chip Flash
                 (used for production or target debugging)

  SAM4S RAM:     configured for on-chip RAM
                 (used for target debugging)

Note:
   For the Serial Wire Viewer Core Clock: use 96 MHz.
