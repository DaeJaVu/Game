The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM4S16C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM4S-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  =  96 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA     =  96 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - colour GLCD display shows
   - init message
   - AD value and bargraph (depending on potentiometer position)
   - buttons status
 - AD conversion is done in DMA or IRQ mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1
   - USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAM4S RAM:             configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)

  SAM4S Flash:           configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)

  SAM4S Flash + GPNVM:   configured for on-chip Flash
                         configures GPNVM bits to boot from Flash Bank


Note:
   For the Serial Wire Viewer Core Clock: use 96 MHz.
