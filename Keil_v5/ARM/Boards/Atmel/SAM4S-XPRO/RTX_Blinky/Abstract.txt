The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
Atmel 'ATSAM4SD32C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM4S Xplained pro' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =  12 MHz
   - PLLA                  =  96 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLA     =  96 MHz


 - 1 LED blinks with a fixed speed.
   (two RTX tasks are used to blink the LED)

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAM4S RAM:             configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)

  SAM4S Flash:           configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)
