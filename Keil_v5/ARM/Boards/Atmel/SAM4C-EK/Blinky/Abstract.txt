The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM4C16C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM4C-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =   8 MHz
   - PLLB                  =  96 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLB     =  96 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 3 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in DMA or IRQ mode
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART2
   - USART2 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAM4C RAM:             configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)

  SAM4C Flash:           configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)


Note:
   For the Serial Wire Viewer Core Clock: use 96 MHz.
