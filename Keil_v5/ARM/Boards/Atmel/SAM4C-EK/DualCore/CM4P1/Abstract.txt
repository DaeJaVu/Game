The 'CM4P1 Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM4C16C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM4C-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

This example demonstrates how to configure dual core application project
in order to use SAM4C CM4P1 core together with SAM4C CM4P0 core.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - CPU = 8.00 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LED D10 is toggled with the speed depending on SysTick Timer interrupt period

 
The CM4P1 Blinky program is available for target:

  SAM4C_CM4P1:     runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (may be used for target debugging)



Note:
  CM4P1 application image "CM4P1_Image.c" is copied into CM4P0 project folder and
  loaded into internal RAM using CM4P0 core.
  
  Debug of the CM4P1 application is possible after CM4P1 image is loaded into SRAM1
  and CM4P1 core is released from reset by CM4P0.
