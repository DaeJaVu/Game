The 'CM4P0 Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Atmel 'ATSAM4C16C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM4C-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

This example demonstrates how to configure dual core application project
in order to use SAM4C CM4P1 core together with SAM4C CM4P0 core.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL =   8.00 MHz
   - CPU  =  96.00 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - LED D8 is toggled with the speed depending on SysTick Timer interrupt period

 - LED D9 is toggled using IPC communication
 
 - CM4P0 application must load CM4P1 application image into SAM4C internal RAM (SRAM1)
   and release CM4P1 core from reset. CM4P1 application image can be found in the
   file CM4P1_Image.c which is build using CM4P1 Blinky project.


The CM4P0 Blinky program is available for different targets:

  SAM4C_CM4P0 RAM:     runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                       (may be used for target debugging)

  SAM4C_CM4P0 Flash:   runs from InternalFlash located on chip
