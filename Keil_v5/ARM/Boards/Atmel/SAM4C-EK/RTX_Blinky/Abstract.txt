The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
Atmel 'ATSAM4C16C' microcontroller using Atmel 'SAM4C-EK' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL                  =   8 MHz
   - PLLB                  =  96 MHz
   - Main Clock = PLLB     =  96 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SAM4C RAM:             configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)

  SAM4C Flash:           configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)
