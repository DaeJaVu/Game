The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for the Toshiba 'TMPM369FDFG' microcontroller
using Yokogawa Digital Computer Corporation 'Evaluation Board for Toshiba TMPM369FDFG'.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

It demonstrates the use of ULINKpro Debugger.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  16 MHz
   - PLL        =  80 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  80 MHz

 - 4 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if any Button (S3..S6) is pressed all LEDs are lit.
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port UART1 (SC0)
   UART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  SWO Trace:                 runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace

  TracePort Trace:           runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of LogicAnalyzer, ITM output, Exception Trace

  TracePort IntructionTrace: runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of Instruction Trace
					         use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"


ULINKpro notes
--------------
TMPM369_TPIU.ini enables TPIU Interfcace. 
                 TPIU signals are available on the pins hosting them. 
Trace pins:  TRACECLK        PA.6
             TRACEDATA0..3   PB.0..PB.1, PA.6..PA.7    (4 bit trace data)
             do not use these pins in your application!

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).
