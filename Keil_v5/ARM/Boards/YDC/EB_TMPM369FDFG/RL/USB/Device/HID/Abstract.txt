The HID project is a demo program for the EB_TMPM369FDFG  
Board using a Toshiba TMPM369FDFG  Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 4 LEDs
  - 4 BUTTONs (S3, S4, S5, S6)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  TMPM369:           configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                     (used for production or target debugging)
