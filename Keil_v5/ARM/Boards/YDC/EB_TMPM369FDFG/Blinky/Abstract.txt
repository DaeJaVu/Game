The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for the Toshiba 'TMPM369FDFG' microcontroller
using Yokogawa Digital Computer Corporation 'Evaluation Board for Toshiba TMPM369FDFG'.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL       =  16 MHz
   - PLL        =  80 MHz
   - CPU Clock  =  80 MHz

 - 4 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - if any Button (S3..S6) is pressed all LEDs are lit.
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port UART1 (SC0)
   UART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  TMPM369 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  TMPM369 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
