The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for
Infineon 'XMC1200-200' microcontroller using Infineon 'XMC1200 Boot Kit'.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL (DC01) =  64 MHz
   - CPU Clock   =   8 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  XMC1200 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  XMC1200 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
