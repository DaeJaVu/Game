The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
Infineon 'XMC1200-200' microcontroller using Infineon 'XMC1200 Boot Kit'.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL (DC01) =  64 MHz
   - CPU Clock   =   8 MHz

 - 5 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  XMC1200 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  XMC1200 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
