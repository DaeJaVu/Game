The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
Infineon 'XMC4500' microcontroller using Infineon 'Relax Lite Kit' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - CCLK  = 120 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  XMC4500 PSRAM: runs from Internal PSRAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  XMC4500 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)



Note: Board 'Relax Lite Kit' exists in two versions
       'prototype'  (LEDS connected to P2.14..15).
       'productive' (LEDs connected to P1.0..1).
      Define __PROTOTYPE selects the version 'prototype' (see 'options for target - C/C++ - Define).
      This example is configured for version 'prototype'.
