The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the Infineon 'XMC4400' 
microcontroller using Infineon 'CPU_44A-V1' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - CCLK  = 120 MHz

 - 2 LEDs blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  XMC4400 PSRAM:        runs from Internal PSRAM located on chip
                        (used for target debugging)

  XMC4400 Flash:        runs from Internal Flash (uncached) located on chip
                        (used for production or target debugging)

  XMC4400 cached Flash: runs from Internal Flash (cached) located on chip
                        (used for production or target debugging)
