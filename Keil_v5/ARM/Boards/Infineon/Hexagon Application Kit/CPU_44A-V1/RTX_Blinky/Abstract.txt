The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
Infineon 'XMC4400' microcontroller using Infineon 'CPU_44A-V1' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - CCLK  = 120 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  XMC4400 PSRAM: runs from Internal PSRAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  XMC4400 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
