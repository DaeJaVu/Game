This program is a BSD Client example. It is used to send commands
to a BSD_server or LEDSwitch server connected on the same LAN. The 
sending commands control LED diodes on remote Server, how they are
switched on or off.

In order to run this example, you need to set the network parameters
to match your local area network.

To test this example, run BSD_server or LEDSwitch server on eval board
and Client application on another eval board connected on the same LAN. 
The Client sends the value of P2 to BSD_server over TCP or UDP.

NOTE: IP address and MAC address of this example must be set different
      from IP and MAC addressess on LEDSwitch Server.

The BSD_client example is available for several targets:

XMC4500:
    Standalone application for the Hexagon Application Kit.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.

XMC4500 Debug:
    Standalone Debug application.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.
    
    Debug level is configured in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    ITM debug port is used as a communication interface.
    You can debug the application with ULINK2 from uVision Debug Session:
    Start Debug session (Ctrl + F5) and open Debug (printf)
    Viewer (View->Serial Windows->Debug (printf) Viewer).
