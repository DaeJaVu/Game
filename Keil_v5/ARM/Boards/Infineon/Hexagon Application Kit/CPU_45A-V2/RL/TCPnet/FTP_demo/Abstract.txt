This is a FTP Server example. It allows you to manage files
on SD Card from PC using FTP client.

Use this example to connect Hexagon Application Kit board to a LAN
with DHCP server (most LANs have this). This example will configure
the LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect the board
to PC directly over a crosslink network cable. In this
case configure a PC to use a static IP address 192.168.0.1 and
disable the 'Dynamic Host Configuration' in Net_Config.c
configuration file. The default static IP address of
Hexagon Application Kit board is then 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your ftp client and enter the
address ftp://xmc4500/ or ftp://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

The FTP_demo example is available for several targets:

XMC4500:
    Standalone application for the Hexagon Application Kit.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.

XMC4500 Debug:
    Standalone Debug application.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.
    
    Debug level is configured in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    ITM debug port is used as a communication interface.
    You can debug the application with ULINK2 from uVision Debug Session:
    Start Debug session (Ctrl + F5) and open Debug (printf)
    Viewer (View->Serial Windows->Debug (printf) Viewer).
