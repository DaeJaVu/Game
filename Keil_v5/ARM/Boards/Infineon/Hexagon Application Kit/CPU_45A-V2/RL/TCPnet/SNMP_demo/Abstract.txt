This program is an SNMP Agent demo example. It shows how to 
use a Simple Network Management Protocol to control the
embedded system.

Use this example to connect Hexagon Application Kit board to a LAN
with DHCP server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect the board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

To test this example, run windows application 'SNMPTest.exe' and
type in the ip address of your Embedded SNMP Agent and click
'Connect'. When connected, you can change the LCD text on
the target, control the onboard LED diodes and monitor the
state of onboard pushbuttons.

The SNMP_demo example is available for several targets:

XMC4500:
    Standalone application for the Hexagon Application Kit.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.

XMC4500 Debug:
    Standalone Debug application.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.
    
    Debug level is configured in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    ITM debug port is used as a communication interface.
    You can debug the application with ULINK2 from uVision Debug Session:
    Start Debug session (Ctrl + F5) and open Debug (printf)
    Viewer (View->Serial Windows->Debug (printf) Viewer).
