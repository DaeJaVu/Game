This program shows you how to resolve an IP address of a Host
from the Host name. It sends a DNS request to a remote DNS server. 

This example will configure the LAN network parameters for 
the evaluation board automatically if a DHCP Server is available
in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

The DNS_demo example is available for several targets:

XMC4500:
    Standalone application for the Hexagon Application Kit.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.
    System messages printed to ITM debug port!

XMC4500 Debug:
    Standalone Debug application.
    Program code is loaded into internal flash.
    
    Debug level is configured in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
    ITM debug port is used as a communication interface.
    You can debug the application with ULINK2 from uVision Debug Session:
    Start Debug session (Ctrl + F5) and open Debug (printf)
    Viewer (View->Serial Windows->Debug (printf) Viewer).
