This example program shows how to use the RTX CAN Driver on 
'Infineon CPU_45A-V2 CPU Board XMC4500 General Purpose' and 
'Infineon COM_ETH-V1 Ethernet/CAN/RS485 Interface Card' with 
'Infineon XMC4500' microcontroller.

 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL            =  12 MHz
   - PLL             = 120 MHz
   - PLLUSB          =  48 MHz
   - SYS    = PLL    = 120 MHz
   - CPU    = SYS    = 120 MHz
   - CCU    = SYS    = 120 MHz
   - PERIPH = CPU    = 120 MHz
   - USB    = PLLUSB =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - CAN node 3:       500 kbits

Example functionality:
 - set incrementing byte value every 1 second to a message that 
   will be automatically returned upon reception of Remote 
   Transmission Request (ID = 0x20)
 - send Remote Transmission Request every 1 second and 
   display lowest (LSB) 1 bit of received byte on the 
   LED (ID = 0x21)

This example shows how to use RTX CAN Driver.


The CAN_Ex2 example program is available for one target:

XMC4500 Flash: Standalone application for the XMC4500 Board.
