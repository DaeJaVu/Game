This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL            =  12 MHz
   - PLL             = 120 MHz
   - PLLUSB          =  48 MHz
   - SYS    = PLL    = 120 MHz
   - CPU    = SYS    = 120 MHz
   - CCU    = SYS    = 120 MHz
   - PERIPH = CPU    = 120 MHz
   - USB    = PLLUSB =  48 MHz

The SD_File program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:


XMC4500 Flash ITM:  Standalone application for Infineon Hexagon Application
                    Kit using ITM debug port as a communication interface.

                    You can test it with ULINK2 from uVision Debug Session:
                    Start Debug session (Ctrl + F5) and open Debug (printf)
                    Viewer (View->Serial Windows->Debug (printf) Viewer).
