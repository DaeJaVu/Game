The HID project is a demo program for the Infineon CPU_45A-V2 
evaluation board using a Infineon XMC4500 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 1 LED
  - 7 simulated buttons

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
XMC4500_RTX :  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
              (used for production or target debugging)
