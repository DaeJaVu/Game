The Memory project is a demo program for the Infineon CPU_45A-V2 
evaluation board using a Infineon XMC4500 Microcontroller.
   
It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.
