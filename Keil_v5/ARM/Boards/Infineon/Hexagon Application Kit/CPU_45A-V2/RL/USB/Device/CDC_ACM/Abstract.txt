The Virtual COM Port project is a demo program for the Infineon CPU_45A-V2 Board 
using an Infineon XMC4500 Microcontroller.
It demonstrates a bridge between USB USB Virtual COM port and UART port on the 
evaluation board and is based on a Windows USB host driver (usbser.sys).

The PC will install a Virtual COM Port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
After installation an additional port "XMC4500 USB VCom Port(COMx)"
can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different 
"x" displayed on the device manager. The USB host driver assigns "x" 
dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration of the system.
   
Testing the USB Virtual COM Port with ITM:

  Open one Hyperterminal window. 
      One with "XMC4500 USB VCom Port(COMx)" 
  Start the debug session (Ctrl + F5) and run the example (F5).
  Open the View -> Serial Windows ->Debug (printf) Viewer
  Data from "COM1" will be echoed in the Debug (printf) Viewer and vice versa. 
  So, this is bi-directional communication between the ITM on XMC4500 and the 
  Virtual COM Port COMx on host PC.

The Virtual COM Port program is available for the following target:
  XMC4500 Flash:     configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                    (used for production or target debugging)
