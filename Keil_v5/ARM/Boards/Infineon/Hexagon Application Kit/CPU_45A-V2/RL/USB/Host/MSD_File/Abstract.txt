This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL            =  12 MHz
   - PLL             = 120 MHz
   - PLLUSB          =  48 MHz
   - SYS    = PLL    = 120 MHz
   - CPU    = SYS    = 120 MHz
   - CCU    = SYS    = 120 MHz
   - PERIPH = CPU    = 120 MHz
   - USB    = PLLUSB =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - ITM channel

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

  XMC4500 Flash ITM:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip using 
                        ITM channel as a communication interface.
                        (used for production or target debugging)


Notes:   - Cable necessary for connecting USB memory device should have 
           USB micro-A plug connector on one side and Standard USB Type-A 
           receptacle connector on the other side.
