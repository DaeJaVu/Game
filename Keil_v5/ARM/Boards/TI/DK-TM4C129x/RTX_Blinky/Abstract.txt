The 'Blinky' project is a simple RTX based program for
TI 'TM4C129XNCZAD' microcontroller using TI 'EK-TM4C129x' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             = 25.00 MHz
   - SYS =  PIOSC     = 16.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  TM4C129 RAM:           configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)

  TM4C129 Flash:         configured for on-chip Flash
                     (used for production or target debugging)
