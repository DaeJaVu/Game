The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
TI 'TM4C123GH6PGE' microcontroller using TI 'EK-LM4F232' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL             = 16.00 MHz
   - SYS   = PLL/8    = 50.00 MHz

 - 1 LED blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  TM4C123 RAM:           configured for on-chip RAM
                         (used for debugging)

  TM4C123 Flash:         configured for on-chip Flash
                         (used for production or target debugging)
