The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for TI TMS470Mx series
microcontroller using the TI 'TMS470M Hercules' evaluation board 
populated with the 'TMS470MF06607' device.

Example functionality
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core    clock =  80 MHz
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 6 LEDs (HET0..5) blink every 500 ms (250 ms on, 250 ms off) 

The Blinky program is available for different targets:
  JLink - Flash:                  Debug/Target Driver is configured as JLINK
                                   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  JLink - RAM:                    Debug/Target Driver is configured as JLINK
                                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)

JLink Note:
- Regular J-Link hardware version must be higher than 8.00.
