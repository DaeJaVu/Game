The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
NXP 'LPC11U37' microcontroller using NGX 'BlueBoard-LPC11U37', 
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL              =  12 MHz
   - PLL0              =  48 MHz
   - PLL1              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK   = PLL0 / 1 =  48 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC11U37 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                  (used for target debugging)

  LPC11U37 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (used for production or target debugging)
