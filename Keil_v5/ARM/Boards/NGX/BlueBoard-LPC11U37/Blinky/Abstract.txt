The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC11U37' 
microcontroller using NGX 'BlueBoard-LPC11U37', compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL              =  12 MHz
   - PLL0              =  48 MHz
   - PLL1              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK   = PLL0 / 1 =  48 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 2 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART 
 - USART settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC11U37 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                  (used for target debugging)

  LPC11U37 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (used for production or target debugging)
