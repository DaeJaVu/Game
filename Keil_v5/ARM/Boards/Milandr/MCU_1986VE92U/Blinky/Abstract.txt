The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Milandr 'MDR32F9Q2I' 
microcontroller using Milandr 'MCU 1986VE92U' Evaluation Board, 
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =   8 MHz
   - CCLK  =   8 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 2 LEDs blink with speed of 250ms
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port UART2 
 - UART2 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  MDR32F9x Flash: configured for on-chip Flash
                  (used for production or target debugging)

  MDR32F9x RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM
                  (used for target debugging)
