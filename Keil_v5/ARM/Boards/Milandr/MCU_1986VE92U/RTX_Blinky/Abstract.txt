The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
Milandr 'MDR32F9Q2I' microcontroller using Milandr 'MCU 1986VE92U' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =   8 MHz
   - CCLK  =   8 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  MDR32F9x Flash: configured for on-chip Flash
                  (used for production or target debugging)

  MDR32F9x RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM
                  (used for target debugging)
