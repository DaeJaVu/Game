The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC812M101'
microcontroller using Embedded Artists 'LPCXpresso LPC800' Evaluation Board,
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).
It demonstrates the usage of MTB( Micro Trace Buffer).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  12 MHz
   - CPU     =  24 MHz

 - 3 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  ULink-MTB:        	Configured for on-chip Flash, Debug/Target Driver is
						configured as ULINK; shows use of MTB (Micro Trace Buffer)

  ULinkPro-MTB:        	Configured for on-chip Flash, Debug/Target Driver is
						configured as ULINKPro; shows use of MTB (Micro Trace Buffer)


- MTB (Micro Trace Buffer) Notes
--------------------------------
- Dbg_MTB.ini file configures MTB settings, which allows to configure MTB RAM buffer size, buffer position, and flow control.
- MTB allocates user-defined region of the system RAM for storing instruction address change-of-flow data packets.
  Modify MTB position and size to define the used memory region. The position must be a multiple of the buffer size.
  The allocated buffer region cannot be used as application RAM.
