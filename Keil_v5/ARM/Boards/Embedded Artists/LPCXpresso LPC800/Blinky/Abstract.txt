The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC812M101'
microcontroller using Embedded Artists 'LPCXpresso LPC800' Evaluation Board,
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  12 MHz
   - CPU     =  24 MHz

 - 3 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC812M101 Flash:        configured for on-chip Flash
                          (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC812M101 RAM:          configured for on-chip RAM
                          (used for target debugging)
