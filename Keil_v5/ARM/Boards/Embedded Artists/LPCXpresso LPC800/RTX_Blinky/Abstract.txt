The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for the NXP 'LPC812M101'
microcontroller using Embedded Artists 'LPCXpresso LPC800' Evaluation Board,
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  12 MHz
   - CPU     =  24 MHz

This simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC812M101 Flash:        configured for on-chip Flash
                          (used for production or target debugging)
