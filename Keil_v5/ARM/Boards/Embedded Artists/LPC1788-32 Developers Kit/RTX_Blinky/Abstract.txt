The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
NXP 'LPC1788' microcontroller using Embedded Artists 'LPC1788-32 Developer's Kit', 
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL              =  12 MHz
   - PLL0              = 120 MHz
   - PLL1              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK   = PLL0 / 1 = 120 MHz
   - PCLK   = PLL0 / 2 =  60 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:     configured for software Simulator

  LPC1788 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  LPC1788 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
