This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card. 

The SD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for two targets:

LPC1788 Flash:      Standalone application for Embedded Artists LPC1788 
                    Board using serial port as a communication interface.

                    Connect a serial cable to RS232 UART2 port using
                    HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
                    1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

LPC1788 Flash ITM:  Standalone application for Embedded Artists LPC1788 
                    Board using ITM debug port as a communication interface.

                    You can test it with ULINK2 from uVision Debug Session:
                    Start Debug session (Ctrl + F5) and open Debug (printf)
                    Viewer (View->Serial Windows->Debug (printf) Viewer).


Jumper settings (OEM Base Board Rev A):
  To enable UART2: - JP12: Connect pin 2 and 3
                   - JP13: Connect pin 2 and 3
                   - JP6:  Connect pin 5 and 6,
                           pins 1, 2, 3, 4 must be open
