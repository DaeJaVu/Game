This program shows you how to resolve an IP address of a Host
from the Host name. It sends a DNS request to a remote DNS server. 

This example will configure the LAN network parameters for 
the evaluation board automatically if a DHCP Server is available
in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

The DNS_demo example is available for several targets:

LPC1788:        Standalone application for EA LPC1788-32 Developer Kit Board.
                Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

LPC1788 Debug:  Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
                in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
                System messages printed to RS232 serial port.

                Connect a serial cable to RS232 UART2 port to view
                output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
                8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.


Jumper settings (OEM Base Board Rev A):
  To enable UART2: - JP12: Connect pin 2 and 3
                   - JP13: Connect pin 2 and 3
                   - JP6:  Connect pin 5 and 6,
                           pins 1, 2, 3, 4 must be open
