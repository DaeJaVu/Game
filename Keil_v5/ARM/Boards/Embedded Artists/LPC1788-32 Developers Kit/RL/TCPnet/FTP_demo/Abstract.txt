This is a FTP Server example. It allows you to manage files
on SD Card from PC using FTP client.

Use this example to connect Embedded Artists LPC1788-32 Developer Kit Board
to a LAN with DHCP server (most LANs have this). This example will configure
the LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect evaluation board
to PC directly over a crosslink network cable. In this case configure
a PC to use a static IP address 192.168.0.1 and disable the
'Dynamic Host Configuration' in Net_Config.c configuration file.
The default static IP address of evaluation board is then 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your ftp client and enter the 
address ftp://lpc1788/ or ftp://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

The FTP_demo example is available for several targets:

LPC1788:        Standalone application for EA LPC1788-32 Developer Kit Board.
                Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

LPC1788 Debug:  Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
                in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
                Connect a serial cable to RS232 UART2 port to view
                output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
                8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.


Jumper settings (OEM Base Board Rev A):
  To enable UART2: - JP12: Connect pin 2 and 3
                   - JP13: Connect pin 2 and 3
                   - JP6:  Connect pin 5 and 6,
                           pins 1, 2, 3, 4 must be open
