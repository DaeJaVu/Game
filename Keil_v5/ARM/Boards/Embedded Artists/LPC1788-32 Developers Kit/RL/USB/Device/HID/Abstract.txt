The HID project is a demo program for the Embedded Artists
LPC1788-32 Developers Kit using a NXP LPC1788 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 8 LEDs
  - 4 Push Button (SW2..5)

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
through a custom HID Client Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  MCB1788_USB1:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                (used for production or target debugging)
  MCB1788_USB2:  configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                (used for production or target debugging)
