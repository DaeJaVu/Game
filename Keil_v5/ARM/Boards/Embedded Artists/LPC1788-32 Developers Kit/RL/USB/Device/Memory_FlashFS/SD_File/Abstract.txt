The SD_File project is a demo program for the Embedde Artist 
LPC1788-32 Developers Kit using NXP LPC1850 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

File manipulation from the target is also available over serial port.

When Wakeup button is pressed the USB Memory is unmounted from the PC
and can be accessed from the target over serial port. It allows to 
create, read, copy, delete files and format the card.
Pressing Wakeup button again, will re-mount the USB Memory on the PC.
