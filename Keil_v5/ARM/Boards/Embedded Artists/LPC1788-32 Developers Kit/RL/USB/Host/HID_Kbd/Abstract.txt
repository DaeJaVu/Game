This is an RL-USB-Host Human Interface Device (HID) usage example.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL              =  12 MHz
   - CCO0              = 240 MHz
   - PLL0   = CCO0 / 2 = 120 MHz
   - CCO1              = 192 MHz
   - PLL1   = CCO1 / 4 =  48 MHz
   - CCLK   = PLL0     = 120 MHz
   - EMCCLK = PLL0 / 2 =  60 MHz
   - PCLK   = PLL0 / 2 =  60 MHz
   - USBCLK = PLL1     =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART2: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

This example shows how to use USB Keyboard (connected to any port) 
as terminal input to the device and it uses COM port as terminal output.

The Measure example is described in detail in the Getting Started
User's Guide.

The HID_KBD program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

EA LPC1788: Standalone application for Embedded Artists LPC1788 Board 
            using COM port as a communication interface.

IMPORTANT Note !!!:
  for using USB1 port (on J20 conncetor) in Host mode it is necessary 
  to solder R163 resistor of 0 Ohms
