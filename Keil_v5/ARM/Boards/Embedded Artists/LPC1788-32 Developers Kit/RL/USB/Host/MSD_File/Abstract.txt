This is an RL-USB-Host and RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL              =  12 MHz
   - CCO0              = 240 MHz
   - PLL0   = CCO0 / 2 = 120 MHz
   - CCO1              = 192 MHz
   - PLL1   = CCO1 / 4 =  48 MHz
   - CCLK   = PLL0     = 120 MHz
   - EMCCLK = PLL0 / 2 =  60 MHz
   - PCLK   = PLL0 / 2 =  60 MHz
   - USBCLK = PLL1     =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - UART2: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

EA LPC1788: Standalone application for Embedded Artists LPC1788 Board 
            using COM port as a communication interface.

IMPORTANT Note !!!:
  for using USB1 port (on J20 conncetor) in Host mode it is necessary 
  to solder R163 resistor of 0 Ohms
