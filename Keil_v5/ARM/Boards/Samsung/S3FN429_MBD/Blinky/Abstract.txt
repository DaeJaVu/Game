The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Samsung S3FN429  
microcontroller using Samsung 'S3FN429_MBD' evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v3.01).

Example functionality
 - HCLK runs at 40 MHz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 4 LEDs (D.7..10) blink every 250 ms 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  S3FN429 - Flash:                 runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  S3FN429 - Flash + Smart Opt:     S3FN429 with Smart Option
                                  (used for production)
