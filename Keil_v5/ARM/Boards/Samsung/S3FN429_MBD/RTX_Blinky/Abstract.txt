The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Samsung S3FN429  
microcontroller using Samsung 'S3FN429_MBD' evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V3.01).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 40 MHz                                                   

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. 4 LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  S3FN429 - Flash:                 runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)
