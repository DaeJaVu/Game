The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Samsung S3FM02G  
microcontroller using Samsung 'S3FM02G_MBD' evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Example functionality
 - HCLK runs at 37.5 MHz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 4 LEDs (D.5..8) blink every 250 ms 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  S3FM02G - Flash:                 runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                  (used for production or target debugging)

  S3FM02G - RAM:                   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                                  (used for target debugging)

  S3FM02G - Flash + Smart Opt:     S3FM02G with Smart Option
                                  (used for programming)
