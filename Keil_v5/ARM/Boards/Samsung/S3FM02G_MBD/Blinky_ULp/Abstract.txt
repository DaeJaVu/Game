The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for Samsung S3FM02G  
microcontroller using Samsung 'S3FM02G_MBD' evaluation board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

It demonstrates the use of ULINKpro Debugger.

Example functionality
 - HCLK runs at 37.5 MHz                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 4 LEDs (D.5..8) blink every 250 ms 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  TracePort IntructionTrace: runs from Internal Flash
                             shows use of Instruction Trace
                             use connector "Cortex Debug + ETM"


ULINKpro notes
--------------
Dbg_TPIU.ini enables TPIU Interfcace. 
                 TPIU signals are available on the pins hosting them. 
Trace pins:  TRACEDCLK        P3.4
             TRACEDATA0..3    P3.0..P3.3    (4 bit trace data)
             do not use these pins in your application!

Instruction trace is very time and resource consuming
therefore if you want to use instruction trace use
nothing else (no LA, no exceptions, no ITM, no ...).
