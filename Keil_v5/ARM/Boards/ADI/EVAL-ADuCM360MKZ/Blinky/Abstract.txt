The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the ADuCM360 microcontroller 
using AnalogDevices 'EVAL-ADuCM360MKZ' Board, compliant
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =    
   - CPU     =    (HFOSC) 16.00 MHz

 - 1 LED blink with a fixed speed, determined by SysTick Timer
     working in interrupt mode
 - "Hello World" is output onto serial port UART 
   UART settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  ADuCM360 Flash:     configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  ADuCM360 RAM:       configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
