The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example for 
'ADuCM360' microcontroller using AnalogDevices 'EVAL-ADuCM360MKZ' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =    
   - CPU     =    (HFOSC) 16.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example uses two RTX tasks
to blink a LED.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  ADuCM360 Flash:     configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)

  ADuCM360 RAM:       configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
