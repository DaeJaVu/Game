This is a FTP Server example. It allows you to manage files
on SD Card from PC using FTP client.

Use this example to connect XYNERGY Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect XYNERGY
Board to PC directly over a crosslink network cable. In this
case configure a PC to use a static IP address 192.168.0.1 and
disable the 'Dynamic Host Configuration' in Net_Config.c
configuration file. The default static IP address of
XYNERGY is then 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your ftp client and enter the
address ftp://xynergy or ftp://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>
