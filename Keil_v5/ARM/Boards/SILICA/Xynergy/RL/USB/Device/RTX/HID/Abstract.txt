The HID project is a demo program for the Silica XYNERGY
Board using a ST STM32F217 Microcontroller.

It demonstrates an USB HID (Human Interface Device):
  - 2 LEDs

The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
can then be accessed from the PC through a custom HID Client 
Program.

The HID program is available for the following target:
  STM32F217 OTG FS RTX:   configured for on-chip Flash ROM, RTX version
                         (used for production or target debugging)
