You can create, read, copy, delete files from the Mass Storage 
Device and format the device. 

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL   =  25 MHz
   - CPUCLK = 120 MHz
   - USBCLK =  48 MHz

 - Communication Interface Settings:
   - USB FTDI (USART6): 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

The MSD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

STM32F217 OTG FS: Standalone application for Silica XYNERGY Board using
