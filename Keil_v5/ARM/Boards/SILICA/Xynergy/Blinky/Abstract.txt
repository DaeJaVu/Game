The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the STM32F217
microcontroller using Silica 'Xynergy' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  = 120.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = 120.00 MHz

 - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - ST LEDs are blinking with speed depending on SysTick timer interrupt period
 

The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  STM32F217 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F217 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)
