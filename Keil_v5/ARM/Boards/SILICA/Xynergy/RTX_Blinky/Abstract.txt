The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the ST 'STM32F217' microcontroller using Silica 'Xynergy'
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  = 120.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = 120.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Two LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the two output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B


The RTX_Blinky example program is available for several targets:

  STM32F217 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F217 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)
