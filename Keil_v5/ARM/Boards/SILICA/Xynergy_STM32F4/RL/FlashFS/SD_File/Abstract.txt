This is an RL Flash File System file manipulation example.
You can create, read, copy, delete files from the SD/MMC 
Flash Memory Card and format the card. 

The SD_FILE program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

STM32F417 Flash:
    Standalone application for SILICA Xynergy Board using serial
    port USB FTDI (UART6) as a communication interface.

    Connect a serial cable to USB FTDI COM port using
    HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
    1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.
           
Example properties:
  - Clock settings:
    - XTAL        =  25.00 MHz
    - CPU Clock   = 168.00 MHz

  - USB FTDI (USART6): 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
