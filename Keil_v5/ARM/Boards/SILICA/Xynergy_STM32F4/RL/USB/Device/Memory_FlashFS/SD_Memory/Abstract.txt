The Memory project is a demo program for the Silica XYNERGY
Board using ST STM32F417 Microcontroller.

Example functionality:

  - Clock settings:
    - XTAL          =  25 MHz
    - PLL VCO Clock = 336 MHz
    - CPU Clock     = 168 MHz
    - USB Clock     =  48 MHz

It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.
SD/MMC Card inserted in the target is used for the actual Memory.

The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

The Memory program is a standalone application loaded into
on-chip flash and available for one target:

STM32F417 Flash:  Configured for on-chip Flash ROM
                  (used for production or target debugging)
