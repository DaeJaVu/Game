The Blinky project is a simple program for the Cortex-M3 on 
'Actel A2F200M3F' FPGA using SmartFusion A2F-EVAL-KIT 
and is compliant to the Cortex Microcontroller Software 
Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

It just blinks the user LED with 1 second interval.

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL   =  50 MHz
 - SYSCLK = 100 MHz

The Blinky program is available in target:
  A2F200M3F Flash:   runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

Notes:
  - set jumper JP7  to position 2-3
  - set jumper JP10 to position 2-3
