The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the Cortex-M3 on 'Actel A2F200M3F' FPGA using 
SmartFusion A2F-EVAL-KIT and is compliant to the Cortex 
Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.3).

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL   =  50 MHz
 - SYSCLK = 100 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example drives one LED D4.

The Blinky program is available in target:
  A2F-EVAL-KIT: - runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)
